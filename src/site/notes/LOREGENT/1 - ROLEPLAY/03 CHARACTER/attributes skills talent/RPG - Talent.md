### Talent

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is a natural aptitude for some activity that a character possesses (e.g., being a skilled painter), or it could be something the character has studied (e.g., electrical engineering), a profession (e.g., cook, programmer, healer), or a hobby (e.g., amateur detective). Talent can also be magic (e.g., school of fire, demon summoner, potion master), a superpower (e.g., spider-man, laser eyes, mega strength), or a type of martial art (e.g., boxer, samurai).

Talent indicates the character's primary occupation, their role in the group, or what they are genuinely good at. In video games, the term talent could be equivalent to a class (e.g., ranger, necromancer), a type (e.g., tank, support), or a designation (e.g., healer).

Each character must have at least one talent and can have a maximum of 6 talents. Unless otherwise specified, each player receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/15 points\|15 points]] during character creation to allocate to any skills, talents, or specializations. For every point invested in a talent, the character gains one extra die when performing an activity that requires that talent (e.g., an auto mechanic talent when repairing an engine).

Unless stated otherwise, a player can invest a maximum of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] in each talent. The number of invested points is assessed similarly to attributes or skills (where 0 means an average person and 3 indicates someone very capable).

> [!example]
>* chef 1 = slightly better chef (+ 1 die)
>* chef 2 = good chef (+ 2 dice)
>* chef 3 = great chef (+ 3 dice)
>* chef 4 = excellent chef (+ 4 dice)
>* and so on

If a character has a negative score in a talent (e.g., cook minus 2), they lose points from their dice roll. However, they can still perform specialized activities and, in most cases, prefer doing those activities (like someone who loves to cook, but the food isn't edible).

> [!example]
>* cook minus 1 = really bad cook ( minus 1 die )
>* cook minus 2 = dangerously incompetent cook ( minus 2 dice )

#### Talent and Skills

Talents work as an enhancement to skills. This means that when a character rolls dice for a skill, they can add points from their talent to that skill. However, this only applies when solving a problem requiring education or specific knowledge.

> [!example]
> - A character digs up a crystal and wants to know if it's a diamond or something else.
> - The narrator tells them to roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]].
><br>
> - The character has the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] Geology.
> <br>
> - Therefore, their roll includes: 3 base dice + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] + Geology.

When a character needs to do something that requires education or special knowledge, and they don't have this education or knowledge (i.e., talent), they roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the activity is magical, very special, or very difficult (even for someone with an education), they roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|great disadvantage]].

> [!example]
> - A character wants to hack into a government computer network. However, they don't have a talent that can be used for hacking. Therefore, they will roll with great disadvantage.
><br>
> - A player wants to brew a potion. However, their character doesn't have a talent that can be used for potion making. Therefore, they will roll with great disadvantage (since it involves magic).
> <br>
> - A player wants to steal a car. However, their character doesn't know how to drive. Therefore, they will roll with disadvantage.

Each talent must specify when it can be used, in what activities, circumstances, and situations. For example, if a character is a Cook and wants to defuse a bomb, they cannot use the Cook skill. They need a talent for defusing bombs, such as - Bomb Technician.

Additionally, talents cannot be combined. One talent cannot enhance another talent, and two talents cannot enhance a single skill. When a situation in the story arises that would allow the use of two suitable talents - the character must choose one.

However, each use of a talent must be approved by the narrator. The narrator determines whether the combination (talent + skill) can be used. This depends on the specific situation in the game (for example, when the character is looking for medicines, they can use the Doctor talent).

####  Talent and Combat

Talent is used for solving problems, not for combat. Only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] is used in combat. Specialization can be combined with other skills during combat. You can find more details in the chapters "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]]" and "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|Combat Maneuvers]]."

Regarding talent and combat, if a character has a talent applicable to a specific type of weapon or fighting style, the character rolls a combat roll but does not gain any extra dice from the talent, as only specialization increases the number of dice in a combat roll.

However, if the character does not have an appropriate talent for their weapon (or martial art) and does not have a specialization, their combat roll is made with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. For very complex weapons or under very difficult circumstances, they roll with great disadvantage.
