### Specialization

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] is similar to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]]. However, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] is used exclusively for combat.

A character can add a specialization for a specific weapon, a certain martial art, a particular armor, or a specific branch of magic to their character sheet. Each character can have a maximum of 3 specializations.

Unless otherwise specified, each player receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/15 points\|15 points]] during character creation to allocate to any skills, talents, or specializations. Unless stated otherwise, a player can invest a maximum of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] in each specialization. The number of invested points is assessed similarly to attributes or skills (where 0 means an average person and 3 indicates someone very capable).

If a character wants to assign a specialization for a specific weapon or magic (etc.), they just need to write it down in the list of talents and assign points to it (e.g., medium-sized swords 2).

#### Specialization and Skills

Specialization is used exclusively for combat. It can be combined with skills when the character wants to perform a specific [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]] during combat. Specialization cannot be used with skills when solving problems in the story. Only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is used for that.

When a character needs to do something that requires education or special knowledge, and the character does not have this knowledge or education (i.e., specialization), they roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

When it is an activity that is very special or very difficult (even for someone with education) and the character does not have this knowledge (i.e., specialization), they roll with [[great disadvantage\|great disadvantage]].

#### Specialization and Weapons

Specialization in weapons increases the number of dice in a combat roll when the character uses that weapon. It also increases the maximum damage that the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]] can deal to an enemy.

If the character does not have the appropriate talent for their weapon (or martial art) and does not have the specialization, their combat roll is made with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. For very complex weapons or under very difficult circumstances, they roll with great disadvantage
 
#### Specialization and Armor

Specialization in armor increases the number of armor points when the character is wearing that specific type of armor. For example, with Samurai Armor Specialization 1, the character gains +1 armor point when wearing samurai armor.

However, there is an additional restriction for armor specialization. The character must have their entire body covered by a single type of armor – they cannot wear two or three types of armor. This is because they will not receive any benefits from the specialization

> [!note] 
> If the character, for example, wears samurai gloves and boots, but a different type of helmet, the points invested in the specialization will not count. They will be considered as having no armor specialization. 

Armor specialization must be tied to a profession, type of martial art, or certain magic. The character cannot have a specialization in light armors (i.e., light armors of all kinds) – it must specify the type, for example, light samurai armor.

#### Specialization and Magic

All necessary information can be found in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Basics of Magic\|Magic]].
