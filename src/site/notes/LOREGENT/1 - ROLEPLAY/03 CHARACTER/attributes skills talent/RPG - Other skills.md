### What about other skills?

#### Swimming, Flying, Low Gravity, etc.

To control body movement in unusual materials or situations that hinder or restrict motion, special dice rolls are made. To be precise [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] (e.g., astronaut talent + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] = when floating around a space station in zero gravity).

These special movement rolls determine, whether the character drowns, falls from the sky, collides with something (in a zero-gravity environment), or executes a particular [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]] (in the unusual material) as desired. The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill overall is also used for climbing cliffs, ropes, or fences, and similar activities.

It must be specified for which material the talent can be used, as some materials are similar to each other. If rolling for a different material than what the character is specified for, the dice roll is made with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

> [!note] Categories of Material
>* Liquids (e.g., water = zero-gravity space) 
>* Empty spaces or gases (e.g., air = zero gravity = flying)
>* Granular (e.g., quicksand = snow = beans) and their storm variants (e.g., snowstorm)
>* Muddy (e.g., jelly = swamp)
>* Vertical ( napríklad skaly = tyče = laná )

#### Pilot and Ride

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] is a talent that brings the knowledge of controlling a self-moving vehicle. It is used for its control, piloting, and steering. A character with this talent can adjust their course to avoid obstacles, adjust their speed to reach the goal as soon as possible, or adjust their angle for better shooting from the vehicle.

The talent for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] is rolled in combination with the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]. Other skills can be rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|skill check]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]]. For example, the skill check [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] is rolled when a complex vehicle needs to be started, or when something breaks down in the vehicle. The skill check [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] is rolled during driving. As a check to see if the character notices an obstacle.

When a player allocates points to the talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]], they must choose which type of vehicle the talent applies to. Some vehicles are similar, so points allocated for one vehicle can also apply to another. If a player uses the talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] with a different self-moving vehicle than what the character has designated, the dice from the talent are not counted in the roll. However, the character does not roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

> [!example]  Categories of vehicles (examples)
> * Boards (e.g., skateboard = surfboard = hoverboard )
> 	* in this case it is Talent + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]
>* Personal cars (include all common personal cars)
>* Special personal cars (e.g., sports types like Ferrari, Lamborghini)
>* Vans (e.g., large and long vehicles like buses or trucks)
>* Personal airplanes (include all common planes for one or two persons)
>* Helicopters, Personal spaceships, Military spaceships, Fighters, Fighter-type spaceships, etc.

The Talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (and the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]) is used during [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Chase\|chases]] with cars, (etc.)!

> [!example] Examples of use (there can be more)
> * Piloting a spaceship, driving a car, driving a formula, riding a horse, riding a skateboard,
> * How quickly do they reach the finish line?
> * Do they dodge a bullet when an enemy tries to shoot the tires?
> * The dam breaks, and the character jumps onto a floating tree (which at that moment "turns" into a surfboard)

> [!note]
> - When it comes to flying, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] is used when the device (or wings) are part of the character's body and the character uses their body for direct control (e.g., Ironman, angel, or hang glider).
> - In combination with the talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (and the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]), flying is used when the device is not part of the body and the pilot boards the machine (e.g., into a fighter jet, or helicopter).

#### Healing Wounds

The skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]” is used for healing wounds. If they are deep wounds, infected, or otherwise complicated, the character must have a talent designated for healing (for example, doctor, herbalist, etc.).

For “healing the wounds of a mechanical being,” the skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]” is rolled. The same applies as above - for more complex repairs, the character must have a talent.

#### Navigation

Navigation talent is included in talents such as taxi driver, navigator, sailor, hunter, or city thief. Navigation (or orientation) is rolled as a combination of talent + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]. (for example, taxi driver + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] = when wanting to find a shortcut). This talent works similarly to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], but is focused on spatial orientation, in the landscape, on the planet, or in space. The character has a kind of compass inside them, which helps them know where to go. They know how to read maps, recognize landmarks, navigate a ship by stars, or track (e.g., when hunting an animal).

Navigation (or orientation) is used to find the shortest path if the character wants to avoid an enemy. It is also used in cases where the character wants to find food (e.g., hunt a deer and knows where the pastures are), or when they want to find a plant for a potion.

#### Survival

Survival is the character's ability to survive in the wilderness. Characters can use it for various tasks, such as finding food and water, building a shelter, or even healing injuries.

When rolling dice, a combination of skill and talent is used. For example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] with the talent hunter can be used to find a deer, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] with the talent mushroom picker for finding edible mushrooms, or the talent adventurer with the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] skill to build a shelter.

#### Talking to Animals / Animal Control

A character can talk to animals (like other characters) only if they have a special talent (or know some magic).

To control an animal (any animal of a particular kind), the character needs a talent (e.g., dog trainer, police dog handler, cat lover, tiger breeder). When the character needs the animal to do something: Talent + skill from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] is rolled, against the challenge level required to control the animal (CL = animal's level).

This roll is made against challenge level 3. However, this level is influenced by the animal's nature, training, or mood. And of course, whether the character wants to scare the animal away or “convince” it to bring something. The narrator determines the level of the challenge. The following list can also help.

- Domestication    
    - wild animals increase the challenge by 1        
    - domesticated animals decrease the challenge by 1        
- Nature    
    - aggressive animals have increased challenge by 1        
    - friendly animals have decreased challenge by 1        
- Intelligence    
    - animals that are less intelligent have increased challenge by 1        
    - animals that are intelligent have decreased challenge by 1        
- Relationship to Humans    
    - animals that have been hurt by humans have increased challenge by 2        
    - animals that do not know humans have increased challenge by 1        
    - animals that know humans but have no special relationship with them (e.g., farm cows) have no change in challenge level
    - animals with a good relationship reduce the challenge by 1 or 2, depending on their relationship with humans.        
- and so on.

##### SOC Skills with Animals and Helpers

- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intuition\|Intuition]]: For example, when the character wants to find out how the animal is doing mentally, wants to discover what might scare the animal, or wants to know who the leader in the group is.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]: 90% of rolls. The character tells the animal what to do (literally persuading it).    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]: The character wants to deceive the animal, for example, pretending to be dead so the animal doesn’t eat them.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intimidation\|Intimidation]]: For example, scaring the animal away, or if the animal wants to eat something and the character wants to forbid it.

#### Encryption

When one character talks to another and doesn’t want anyone to know what they are talking about, a combination of Talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] skill is used. The same applies to writing. However, if they write a message and use a computer (or other device) to _encrypt_ it, a combination of Talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] skill is used, with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] being used as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|self-assistance roll]].

To _decrypt_ a message, Talent and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intuition\|Intuition]] (if it is a text that can be normally read) or, for an encrypted file, Talent and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] is used.

#### Throwing Objects

A character wants to throw a stone at an enemy, throw a rope to an ally, or throw a large stone at a group of enemies. They can use these skills:

* When they want to throw something heavy and don’t need to aim precisely = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] is used
* When they want to throw something secretly so that no one notices = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] is used
* When they want to deceive someone that they threw something = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] is used
* When they want to throw something precisely = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] is used.

#### Lockpicking

When a character wants to unlock a lock without keys (with a lockpick), they can use the following skills:

* When it’s a common lock and they want to unlock it quickly = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] is used
* When it’s a complex lock with various mechanisms or is being opened with a device = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] is used
* When they want to break the lock with their hands = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] is used
* The skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]” can also be used to unlock a lock, but it will take twice as long (or the challenge level will be +2)

#### Music and Art

- When playing musical instruments, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] skill is used.
- When painting pictures or creating sculptures, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] skill is used.
- When singing, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] skill is used.
- When acting, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] skill is used.
