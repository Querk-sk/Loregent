### Passive Character Attribute

As stated in the previous chapter, passive attributes are characteristics that "say" whether the character is strong, average, or weak in a certain area. They are called "passive" because they are not used in dice rolls – only skills are "rolled." For instance, if a character needs to push a rock, the player does not roll for the attribute "strength ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]])", but rolls for the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]", which includes the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] (meaning they get 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] for the roll).

Unless otherwise specified, each player receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3 points\|3 points]] to allocate to any of their character's attributes. This number can vary depending on the following:

1. Whether the player chooses to take a "negative" in other attributes (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] minus 1, which increases the total number of points by 1, which can then be allocated to other attributes),    
2. Or if their point total is affected by [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|Disabling Characteristic]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/perk\|perk]] (e.g., the disadvantage "missing an arm" results in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] minus 1).    

The narrator can adjust the number of points as needed for their story (e.g., superheroes will have a different number of points than a regular person).

#### List of Passive Attributes

##### Strength ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]])

Represents overall muscle strength. Strong characters can lift heavy objects or are excellent carriers (like those in the high mountains). Additionally, they have great endurance in terms of stamina (for example, they can run a marathon) and in terms of injury (they can endure more hits).

##### Reflex ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]])

Indicates how fast, flexible, and perceptive a character is. Characters with high reflexes notice many things even before other characters do. They can also react quickly and avoid potential threats.

##### Intelligence ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]])

Describes the overall wisdom of a character. High intelligence is associated with wisdom (the character can come up with good plans, recall important places in the area), good orientation (they never get lost), and skillful hands. Intelligence is also linked to spells and knowledge of magic or technology.

##### Social Skills ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]])

Indicates how a character influences others. Characters with high social skills can persuade others, empathize with their needs and emotional states (which they can then use against them).

#### What Does [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 0 Mean?

Think of attribute points in such a way that **zero** represents an average, ordinary person. Each additional point makes a person one class better in that particular attribute. If a character has a negative point in an attribute, it indicates that the character has some kind of disability.

The number of points that a player or narrator can invest in a character is limited only by the number of points available during the character creation phase. Therefore, there can be characters with STR 10 (for example, gods). However, the minimum amount of points is minus 2. Characters with attributes of minus 3 or minus 4 do not exist. Negatives should be considered as illnesses, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|disabilities]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|disadvantages]], where minus 1 is a mild disability and minus 2 is a severe disability.

##### Strength

( Negative values indicate a character who may be missing a limb, chronically ill, emaciated, or suffering from fatigue syndrome )

0. Average adult
1. Stronger person
2. Regular gym-goer
3. Competitive weightlifter
4. Olympic athlete
5. World champion weightlifter
6. Almost like Captain America

##### Reflex

( Negative values indicate a character who is clumsy – either significantly overweight, inflexible due to joint inflammation, or not very perceptive )

0. Average adult
1. More agile person
2. Amateur athlete, sports car driver, gymnast
3. Professional athlete, sports car driver, gymnast
4. Martial arts master, Olympic gymnast
5. Highest-level martial arts master, highest-level gymnast
6. Almost like Spider-Man

##### Intelligence

( Negative values indicate a character who has difficulty thinking, is clumsy with their hands, or has a neurological disorder. Alternatively, it could refer to a complete stranger in an unfamiliar world – something like E.T. the alien. )

0. Average adult
1. Smarter person
2. Teacher, scientist, artist
3. Very good scientist, artist, teacher
4. Slightly like Sherlock Holmes, intelligent enough to win a Nobel Prize
5. Sherlock Holmes, Nobel Prize winner in science
6. Almost like Megamind

##### Social Skills

( Negative values indicate a character with social phobia, sociopathy, or one who is mute. Alternatively, it could refer to a complete stranger in an alien world who doesn't understand the language – something like E.T. the alien. )

0. Average adult
1. More pleasant person
2. Someone who "knows how to deal with people" – like an advertising agency worker
3. Someone who works very well with people – like a psychologist
4. High-ranking diplomat
5. World's best negotiator
6. Almost like Professor Xavier (from X-Men)

#### Bonuses of Passive Attributes

Attributes provide passive bonuses to the character when points are invested in them. However, if a character has a negative score in an attribute, they lose these passive bonuses.

	- +/- 1 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]
* **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] adds or subtracts**
    - +/- 1 die to intelligence skills
    - +/- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] points that the character can invest in skills, talents, or specializations (this rule is still being tested)
    - +/- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]]
* **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] adds or subtracts**
	- +/- 1 die to social skills
	- +/- 1 to initiative in social combat (more in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat#Social Combat\|chapter on combat]])
	- +/- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/10\|10]] to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]
* **One point in any attribute**
    * +/- 1 to combat and magic rolls

#### Character Age 

If the narrator wishes, they can differentiate the number of points a character can allocate to their attributes based on the character's age.

- Children can allocate 0 points.    
- Adolescents can allocate 1 point.    
- Adults can allocate 2 points.    
- And older people, depending on their life experiences, can allocate up to 3 points. Illness may lower the number of points.
