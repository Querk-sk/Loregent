#### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]]

It is used to control endurance or the ability to move in unusual environments. Mobility mainly involves swimming in water, climbing rocks, rope climbing, or climbing over a fence. It also includes flying in zero gravity or in the air (like Ironman). In simple terms, it’s movement involving the whole body, not just the legs.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] also includes normal movement in relatively normal conditions. If the conditions are not normal, this skill requires a talent. Otherwise, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. (For example, swimming in a pool is different than swimming in the open sea).

##### All Verbs

Movement: 
Climbing, Rock climbing, Climbing, Climbing a rope or tree, Swimming

Change in height: 
Jumping, Flying, Flying in the air, Flying in zero-gravity space

#### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] focuses on the body's defense against attacks – whether physical, chemical, bacterial, etc. If the character has a status (e.g., poison), the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] skill is used to mitigate the effect of the poison. The amount by which the character falls short of the challenge level reduces [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]], gives fewer dice for the next roll, or worsens their overall situation (e.g., unable to walk). If the character surpasses the challenge level, they mitigate the status effect (poison). The more successes they roll, the more they reduce the effect duration (e.g., poison affects for 4 rounds instead of 8). This is just an example; the narrator can adjust it.

##### All Verbs

Resistance to injury: 
Resistance, Deflection, Stopping, Defense, Protection

Resistance to external influences: 
Reach somewhere, Hold on, Keep, Wait, Continue, Not finish, Manage, Stand up

Resistance to poisons:

> * Astronaut - In the space station, they pushed off something harder than usual, so they prepare for impact. They practiced such cases in the simulator back on Earth.
> * Ski mountaineer - Walking through a snowstorm, they roll dice to see how long they last. As a ski mountaineer, they are trained for such cases.
