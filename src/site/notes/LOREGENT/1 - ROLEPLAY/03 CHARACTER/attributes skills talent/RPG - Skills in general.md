### Skills in general

A skill is an activity that character performs in a story when they encounter an obstacle (e.g., locked door), or if a problem occurs (e.g., broken car), or when the character wants to achieve something (e.g., encrypt a message).

#### Skills and Points

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/15 points\|15 points]]** available to invest in any skill (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]]).

The maximum number of points a player can invest in each skill is limited by the narrator. Unless otherwise stated, a player can invest a maximum of 6 points in each skill.

However, a player can also take on negatives. Points can be subtracted from each skill up to a value of minus 2. That is the minimum. A skill cannot be minus 3, and certainly not minus 4.

#### Skills and Dice Rolls

The number of dice a character can use in a skill roll is calculated as follows:

- 3 dice as a base
- plus/minus dice for each point in the given Skill    
- plus/minus dice for each point in the Attribute that is key to the given skill (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] )   
- plus/minus dice for circumstances that may occur in the story (e.g., slippery stairs)

Only one skill can be used for each problem. However, sometimes in a story, a problem can be solved with multiple skills. In such cases, the player must choose one skill, or can choose two, but one of the two chosen skills must be rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

#### Skills and Number of Dice

For every point invested in a skill (talent or specialization), the character gets an extra die when rolling that skill.

>[!example]
 >- The character has 1 point in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]".
 >- When they roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]", they get +1 extra die.
 >- If they had 4 points in the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], they would get +4 extra dice.

A skill can be used even if the character has no points assigned to it. In that case, the player gets 3 base dice for every roll, plus any additional dice for the primary attribute of the skill. If the character has a minus in the skill (or its primary attribute), they lose dice.

> [!example] 
> The character wants to find a potion in a cupboard. For searching, the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill is used. (In this example, the character has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 0)
> 
> * If they have 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill, they will roll 3 dice.
> * If they have 2 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill, they will roll 5 dice.
> * If they have -1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill, they will roll 2 dice.

> [!example]  
> The primary attribute increases the number of dice in the roll. For the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill, the primary attribute is [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].
>  
> - If the character has 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 3 dice.
> - If the character has 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and 1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 4 dice.
> - If the character has 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and -1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 2 dice.

> [!example]
> - If the character has 2 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and 2 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 7 dice.
> - If the character has -1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and 1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 3 dice
> - If the character has 4 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and -1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 6 dice.
> - If the character has 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 3 dice.

#### Skills and Talent

Learn more about this topic in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]]. Here’s a brief overview.

Talent is a character’s natural ability or it’s a profession or hobby. In our RPG system, it’s a supplement to skill. This means that when a character rolls dice for a skill, they can add points from their talent to that skill. This applies when the talent is needed to solve the problem (e.g., a doctor for treating deep wounds, or a mechanic for fixing an engine).

Talent is used only for solving problems or for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice rolls. Talent is not used in combat.

#### Skills and Specialization

Learn more about this topic in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|Specialization]]. Here’s a brief overview.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] is almost the same thing as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]]. However, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] differs from talent in that it’s used only in combat when the character wants to perform a particular [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]].
