### Character in general

In every story, there are characters who work, fight, and so on. Each player has their own character, which they either created themselves or was created by the narrator. The player uses this character to react to what happens in the story. They say everything their character will do, won’t do, wants to do, and what they're thinking about. The player does this similar to how actors portray roles in films – they ‘act’ out their character’s role. The narrator, on the other hand, plays all the other characters in the story that the players don’t control. They are the trader, the bandit, the taxi driver, the boss, the subordinate, and so on. And the narrator plays these characters just like actors in films.

The possibilities for creating characters are limited only by the narrator, their story, and the world’s or RPG system’s rules. What the narrator says or what they agree upon with the players is binding. When creating a character, the player should align the story’s rules with the type of setting or genre.

>[!example]
If it’s a medieval story with dragons, magic, and a crazy comedy theme, then the character could be similar to Jack Sparrow, in the form of a (clumsy) dragon tamer.

It’s also important to think about the fact that in a dangerous environment – the character can die. The RPG system has its rules. If the rules say the character must die, then there’s nothing that can be done about it. The player will then get a new character from the narrator or create a new one. However, in the story, it’s not just death; the character might fall unconscious and wake up elsewhere, turn into a zombie, or time rewinds when they die. (It all depends on the narrator and their story).

#### General Character Traits

Here we will outline some rules regarding characters, mainly the rules for [[Attributes\|Attributes]], [[Skills\|Skills]], [[Talents\|Talents]], and Points. These rules are briefly explained for basic understanding of the game's mechanics. More detailed rules are found in other chapters.

##### Character Attributes – General

Characters' passive attributes determine several things. They indicate what the character is strong at, average at, and weak at. They also determine how many dice the player (or character) gets for their roll, which character will act first in a fight (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Conflict\|conflict]]) and how many points (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health]]) the character gets.

Our RPG system uses 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attributes]]. These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|Strength]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|Reflex]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|Intelligence]], and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|Social Skills]]. Every point the player (or narrator) invests in an attribute increases the number of dice the player (or narrator) can use for their dice roll. This applies when they want to use a skill, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|attack]], defend, or use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|spells]] or techniques.

##### Character Skills – General

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skills]] are categories for actions a character can perform. When a problem arises in the story (e.g., the character needs to swim across a lake), the narrator will state which skill the character must use and then set a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]]. The character will then roll dice for that skill (e.g., for swimming across the lake, the skill is [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]]). Based on the dice roll, the narrator explains the outcome and how the story continues.

##### Character Talents - General

However, when the character does something complex – requiring education or specialization, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is added to the skill roll. But [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] can only be used in situations where specific education or knowledge is needed to solve a problem.

>[!example]
>Talent "Lifeguard" can be used with the skill "mobility" when the character wants to swim across a lake.
>Talent "Lifeguard" cannot be used for heart surgery or car repair.

If the story circumstances require a talent (e.g., heart surgery) but the character lacks it, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]], or if the task is very complex (even for someone with education), the character rolls at a major [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. The same applies to combat. If the character uses a weapon requiring some training (e.g., katana, pistol), they roll at a disadvantage.

##### Points - General

As for other things the character has or doesn't have – these are recorded as points. These include points for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Health]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Wealth]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Speed]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Training\|Training]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Rewards]], and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]. Each type of point serves a different purpose. Health Points decide the character's life or death. Wealth Points determine whether the character can purchase something. Speed Points dictate the combat order and what the character can carry in their inventory (whether in a backpack or hands). Reward Points are a bit complicated but essentially reward the player and offer options. Armor Points are used to block damage.

This is, of course, just a summary, and the exact rules are detailed in the relevant chapter for each point.
