### Nature of the Character

An interesting story needs interesting characters. These are ones that have good qualities, some flaws, important goals, or a complicated past. Simply put, they should have ‘multiple dimensions’. Therefore, it is not suitable to create purely good characters (those who only do good), or purely evil characters (those who only do evil), because such characters tend to be boring from a story perspective.

Every person reacts to the surrounding world in some way. They behave in certain ways, experience misfortune, happiness, and so on. Therefore, characters in stories have personality traits that, although they may not affect the gameplay (i.e., dice rolls), are very important for the story, so the player knows (and especially doesn’t forget) how their character will behave in certain situations. (So the player can play them like an actor in a movie.)

In the list below, personality traits are written and categorized into several categories. The player can choose only one personality trait from each category. The chosen trait should best capture their character. Each trait has its ‘milder’ and ‘more extreme’ version. However, if the player or the narrator can't decide, they can roll the dice and let fate decide for them.

#### Character traits

##### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Community\|Community]]

This is a large category that influences the character's outward behavior towards their surroundings. It determines how the character behaves among people. Whether they prefer to be alone, or whether they take initiative when a problem arises that needs to be solved.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Sociability\|Sociability]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Introvert\|Introvert]] (6, 5) = This is a person who prefers to be alone or deals with a smaller number of people. Being in the company of strangers or large groups of people exhausts them. An introvert focuses on working with computers, books, or other inanimate objects. They dislike working with people (like doctors or salespeople). In extreme cases, they would prefer to be on a deserted island because other people literally drain the life out of them. They prefer interacting with their friends, family, or people they like and know well.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Ambivert\|Ambivert]] (4, 3) = This is a person who doesn’t mind solitude or company, as long as it’s not extreme or for too long. For example, they couldn't handle a deserted island, but also wouldn't enjoy a crowded disco. This person can tolerate people and work with them (as long as it’s not for too long, like meeting new people all week during lectures where they're the center of attention). They enjoy making new contacts but prefer turning them into long-term friends.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Extrovert\|Extrovert]] (2, 1) = This is a person who hates being alone. They always need someone around to talk to. They don’t like when people sit quietly next to each other without conversing. They enjoy working with people, know how to interact with them (like giving advice or managing their anger), and enjoy doing so. In extreme cases, they are constantly seeking out company because when they are alone, they get scared or depressed.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Friendliness\|Friendliness]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Friendly\|Friendly]] ( 6 , 5 ) = This type of person (relatively) quickly makes friends and tries to get along well with everyone. If they are in a foreign environment, they want to meet and befriend everyone—because everyone should be a friend, right? And if not, they feel sad. In extreme cases, they talk to everyone and immediately offer their friendship (and maybe even gifts).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Assertive\|Assertive]] ( 4 , 3 ) = This type of person approaches friendship neutrally. They don't force friendships or enmities and interact with people in a 'regular' way. Because not everyone can be a friend, and not everyone is immediately an enemy.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Unfriendly\|Unfriendly]] (2, 1) = This person doesn't need or want friends. They either manage on their own, isolate themselves from others, or deal with everyone formally. They don’t necessarily want to harm others, but for some, it's not out of the question. On the other hand, a lack of friends may be due to aggression or an inability to interact with people—they may be socially awkward or shy. In extreme cases, it appears the character suffers from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Disabling Characteristic#Item 4 - Sociopathy\|sociopathy]].

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Trust in others\|Trust in others]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Paranoia\|Paranoia]] ( 6 , 5 ) = This person is hard to convince and always needs some proof. When walking down a quiet alley, they expect an attack. In extreme cases, this person trusts virtually nothing and no one (regardless of evidence). They need multiple reassurances that nothing is happening and that no one wants to deceive them.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Average Trust\|Average Trust]] ( 4 , 3 ) = This person knows the world is a dangerous place, but also knows it’s not always so. If they are walking down a quiet alley in a safe part of town, they know they are not in danger. In a dangerous part of town, they are cautious.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Trust\|Trust]] ( 2 , 1 ) = This person knows there are bad people, but believes there is good in every bad person—it just needs to be brought out. Maybe it’s all about the approach. No one is bad; maybe they just had a bad day. And if walking down a quiet alley, even in a dangerous part of town, they will behave as usual, believing they are not in danger. In extreme cases (2b), this person does not believe there are bad people or bad places. They essentially don't check people out. If they are walking down a quiet alley in the most dangerous part of town, they will be singing, believing nothing can harm them.
###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Activity\|Activity]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Initiative\|Initiative]] ( 6 , 5 ) = This person solves problems as soon as they arise and as quickly as possible. They don’t postpone anything until tomorrow, and if the situation requires something to be done, they do it. They hate when someone procrastinates. In extreme cases, this character is hyperactive and, when nothing is happening, they invent something to solve.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Mixed\|Mixed]] ( 4 , 3 ) = This person solves problems, but not necessarily immediately. If something can be postponed, it waits a bit.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Passivity\|Passivity]] ( 2 , 1 ) = This person postpones things. It’s best if problems resolve themselves. They don't like being pushed into solving problems, believing there’s always time. In extreme cases, this character won’t lift a finger, even after multiple urgings.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Perception of the World\|Perception of the World]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Optimism\|Optimism]] (6, 5) = This person perceives the world as better than it actually is and mainly experiences positive emotions. They see the glass as half-full and focus on the full part. In extreme cases, they are like a small sunshine, able to be happy (and spread happiness) even in a total disaster.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Realism\|Realism]] (4, 3) = This person perceives the world as it actually is (or at least tries to). When they see the glass as half-empty, they prepare for the possibility that it will be completely empty. If the glass is filled, they are glad their fears were unfounded.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Pessimism\|Pessimism]] (2, 1) = This person perceives the world as worse than it actually is and mainly experiences negative emotions. They see the glass as half-empty and focus on the empty part. In extreme cases, they are like a total dark cloud, able to be unhappy (and see bad things) even in completely positive situations or celebrations.

##### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Stability\|Stability]]

These are traits that affect the character's emotions, needs, and how they see themselves. All of these traits contribute to the overall emotional stability.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Cleanliness\|Cleanliness]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Chaos\|Chaos]] (6, 5) = This type of person can tolerate disorder. The fact that things are not in their place does not bother them at all (and honestly, they kind of like it because order is boring). It seems they navigate best in chaos—where things don’t necessarily have a head or tail. In extreme cases, they are the king of disorder and chaos, having mess everywhere. (But they know their way around it, at least in 60% of cases). However, their improvisation skills are really strong.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Balance\|Balance]] (4, 3) = This type of person can tolerate a bit of disorder, as long as there is a good reason for it (like when renovating an apartment). But long-term disorder can frustrate them and worsen their overall mood.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Order\|Order]] (2, 1) = This person loves routine and when everything is in its place. They hate disorder (you could even call it an allergy) and are totally lost in chaos (or anything that deviates from order). Things must have a head and a tail. In extreme cases, they are the king of order and routine.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Emotional Response\|Emotional Response]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Sensitive\|Sensitive]] (6, 5) = This person expresses emotions openly. They can’t hide their feelings, and when something is sad, they will be sad and cry. They can empathize with others' emotions and predict how people will react. In extreme cases, this person expresses their emotions too much.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Stable\|Stable]] (4, 3) = Regarding emotions and reading others' emotions, this type of person is average in this skill. However, they have their limit on how long they can control their emotions. Once this limit is exceeded, they will express their emotions.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Stoic\|Stoic]] (2, 1) = As for emotions, this person is not easily shaken. They can perfectly control their reactions to events and there is practically no one who can make them angry. On the other hand, they demand perfect control from others as well. They cannot empathize with others' feelings, or they generally dislike emotions. In extreme cases, they are like a walking logical stone.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Stimuli\|Stimuli]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Excitable\|Excitable]] (6, 5) = This person needs excitement in their life. Something must always be happening, and if it’s not, they will make it happen. They love risk, gambling, and adrenaline activities. They enjoy trying new things. In extreme cases, adrenaline is like a drug for this person.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Moderately Excitable\|Moderately Excitable]] (4, 3) = This person needs a small amount of excitement in their life. They know when to stop, when to take risks, and they also know how to relax. They don’t mind boredom.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Conservative\|Conservative]] (2, 1) = This type of person hates new things, is afraid of adrenaline activities, and dislikes risk. They are happy when nothing changes and everything stays as it was. They don’t like new things; for example, they can wear clothes until they fall apart. In extreme cases, it’s even worse—they avoid anything that looks even a bit new (new game?) or adrenaline-inducing. They cling only to what they know and let nothing new into their life.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Self-Confidence\|Self-Confidence]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/High Self-Confidence\|High Self-Confidence]] (6, 5) = This person believes in themselves. They know they are always right, and they know they can do and solve everything. In extreme cases, this self-confidence is so extreme it becomes arrogance (I am infallible, why are you blaming me?).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Average Self-Confidence\|Average Self-Confidence]] (4, 3) = This person knows their limits. They know what they can and cannot do.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Low Self-Confidence\|Low Self-Confidence]] (2, 1) = This person doesn't believe in themselves. And even if they had three physics diplomas, they would question everything they say unless they really fact-checked it. In extreme cases, this fact-checking is so frequent it borders on OCD (like checking 300 times if they turned off the gas on the stove).

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Lives In\|Lives In]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Fantasy\|Fantasy]] (6, 5) = This person is characterized by abstract thinking. They can imagine things that other people cannot. They live more in the world of fantasy than in the real one. They hate working with facts. In extreme cases, this person lives only in fantasy and is not interested in the real world.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Reality\|Reality]] (4, 3) = This person focuses on the real world. Sometimes they dive into the world of fantasy to relax, but they know life is lived only in the real world. When it comes to their ability to dream and imagine, they are average. They can't imagine everything. On the other hand, they can work with facts.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Facts\|Facts]] (2, 1) = This person is characterized by strict thinking. They can recall factual things that other people cannot. They live mainly in the real world rather than in fantasy. They hate working with imagination. Everything must be supported by solid data—no beliefs, no magic—everything must make sense. In extreme cases, they hate everything that even hints at fantasy. They simply don't believe it or they despise it.

##### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Morality\|Morality]]

This is a category of traits that affect the character's conscience, rule-following, and overall responsibility. Can they lie? Can they sacrifice for the good of others?

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Rule-Following\|Rule-Following]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Flexible\|Flexible]] (6, 5) = This is a person who knows how to bend the rules for their benefit—those they don’t like, they either ignore or interpret to suit themselves. In extreme cases, rules don’t exist for this person.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]] (4, 3) = This person follows rules as long as they make sense. If something is nonsensical (or against their moral principles), they ignore it.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Rigid\|Rigid]] (2, 1) = This person follows rules to the letter. Whether they make sense or not, they were written for a reason and, most importantly, to be followed. In extreme cases, nothing but rules exist—and they must be followed to the letter of the law.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Personality Orientation\|Personality Orientation]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Orbicentric\|Orbicentric]] (6, 5) = This person focuses on the external world and not on themselves (meaning they hardly acknowledge their own needs) and sacrifices for others. Others must be helped—they do not need help themselves. In extreme cases, they prioritize the whole world over their needs.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Centric\|Centric]] (4, 3) = This person is aware of their needs and also the needs of others. They help people based on the context (e.g., in terms of health), whether they can help themselves (because people can exploit kindness), and whether it won’t harm them (e.g., losing all their money).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Egocentric\|Egocentric]] (2, 1) = This person sees only their needs and the needs of others as if they don't exist. To help others, someone must force them or reward them greatly. In extreme cases, they think only of themselves and their needs.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Diligence\|Diligence]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Workaholism\|Workaholism]] (6, 5) = This person loves work. To the extent that they can immerse themselves in it for long hours, regardless of their personal life, the needs of others, and circumstances. The work must be done (this doesn't mean it has to be completed immediately). In extreme cases, they do not stop working.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Average hard worker\|Average hard worker]] (4, 3) = As for work, this person knows when something needs to be done, it needs to be done. On the other hand, they don’t overdo it with work and will pause when tired or when other circumstances arise (and possibly rest).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Laziness\|Laziness]] (2, 1) = This person hates work. They would prefer to rest all day and delay everything indefinitely. They do things at the last minute, after multiple prompts. However, they do focus on others (e.g., their personal life flourishes, just don't expect anything immediately from them). In extreme cases, this person rarely does or completes anything.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Needs\|Needs]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Self-Control\|Self-Control]] (6, 5) = This person can delay gratification and tolerate long periods of frustration, believing that their patience will be generously rewarded. In extreme cases, they refuse pleasure and take joy in denying themselves something.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Sustainable\|Sustainable]] (4, 3) = This person can give up pleasure, but only for a short time. If frustration lasts too long, they lose control (although this depends on their moral compass).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Gluttony\|Gluttony]] (2, 1) = This person wants everything immediately. If you place a kilogram of chocolate in front of them, they will literally eat it all. When there is something they want to buy, they do so almost immediately. (Their gluttony depends on their moral compass). In extreme cases, this person really cannot control themselves.

#### Basic Belief About Oneself

Everyone thinks something about themselves. They are convinced that they are one way or another. This fundamental belief is the foundation of a character, whether they realize it or not. This belief speaks about what the character thinks about themselves, the world, or society. A character might reject emotions and consider anyone who expresses emotions as inferior. They might think of themselves as a total loser who doesn’t deserve anything good. Or they might believe that whatever they do, they only do good for others—that they are always right and always help. They might think that all people are fundamentally good—that they can find goodness even in the worst person. All these beliefs are caused by some event from the past.

Every good story must “attack” this fundamental belief and test the character. Among other things, this can be done by bringing together several characters with conflicting beliefs in one story. Or by putting the character in a situation that shows how their fundamental belief doesn’t work.

#### Character values

Everyone makes decisions based on something. Some things are more important to them than others. This importance is reflected in the so-called ranking of character's values, where a person (or character) arranges desires, goals, objects, people, and so on into a list. The position of each item is very important because things higher up the hierarchy have higher priority and will be preferred. If the character has to choose between two options, they will always choose the one that satisfies the needs (or things) higher up.

Creating a hierarchy is quite simple. One must ask themselves if they could "sacrifice this for something else." For example, family and money. Is the character capable of sacrificing their family for money? And what about art? Is art priceless to the character? The top spots are taken by things that the character would never sacrifice and that are very important to them (therefore, they will take the best care of these things).

#### Character Affinity

The player decides what their character likes (for example, cats, food, video games?), then determines what their character can ignore, while others cannot (for example, they are not bothered by blood?), and finally, the player decides what their character absolutely hates or fears (for example, they hate dogs, refuse to play certain music, are annoyed by books, don't want to attack children). Character affinity serves as a memory aid for the player so that, in the heat of the game, they do not forget what their character avoids or seeks out.

#### Color of a Character

This is simply a tool to help the player or narrator in designing the character. It involves colors (a maximum of 3) that are typical for the character. This could be the color of their hair, the color of the clothes they wear, the color of objects they prefer, or even the color of the magic they use (for example, they wear green clothes and dark green shoes, and have brown hair).

Similarly, shape is also related to color. The player or narrator determines which shape or shapes (a maximum of 2) are typical for the character. Is the character round or does it have "sharp edges" like a cuboid? What is their body posture like? Are they upright and straight, or hunched?

Lastly, there are typical objects associated with the character. Someone might always hold a TV remote control. Someone else might always wear a hat of a certain brand and color. Or someone might always be smeared with motor oil.

#### Belief / Morality

Everyone believes in something, has their unique view of the world, and decides what is good and what is evil. So, a realistic character should also have some stance or moral compass. It can also include faith or a life philosophy. Even the search for one's life philosophy can be considered a life philosophy.

However, if a player or narrator chooses a moral compass, a hierarchy of values, and so on, they should strive to play the character according to THEIR moral compass, not their own. For example, if a player would never steal, but their character is a thief who doesn't care, then the character will steal and have a unique approach to others' property (What is yours is mine. What is mine is none of your business).

#### Goals / Desires

We all want to accomplish something. Each of us wants to do or complete something. Similarly, a character must have some goals. One or two main ones that they always adhere to, and then smaller ones that lead towards the main goals.

Everyone wants to achieve something in life. This can range from big things like world peace to quite ordinary ones like “paying off a mortgage.” Therefore, a character should be assigned something they want to achieve. Naturally, everything should be within the rules of the given world and should be derived from the character's past. It is recommended that the character has multiple goals and desires, both big and small, so that players strive to achieve multiple things in the story.

#### Character's Past

Every character has "something behind them" that got them to where they are now and shaped them into their "current form." The character's past should reflect all the points invested in attributes, skills, and so on, and should also reflect the character's hierarchy of values and settings. However, the past should not be overly detailed to take up an entire book. A few interesting sentences are enough to make everything the player wrote in the character sheet make sense.

>[!example]
A mechanic could have learned their craft at school or from their father. They might love or hate repairing cars—perhaps their father pushed them into mechanics.
