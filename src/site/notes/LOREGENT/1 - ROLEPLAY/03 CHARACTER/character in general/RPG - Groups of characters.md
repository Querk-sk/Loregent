### Groups of characters

Characters in our RPG system are divided into two main groups: Playable and Non-Playable. Playable characters are those controlled by players, while Non-Playable characters are controlled by the narrator. Additionally, characters are classified based on their importance to the story. See the list below.

#### Extras

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Friendly Extra character\|Friendly Extra character]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unfriendly Extra character\|Unfriendly Extra character]]

What it is = A group of characters that serve merely as distraction. They are very weak fighters. To defeat them, the challenge level must be overcome. If a player fails to meet the challenge level – they still kill them but take damage based on how much they fall short of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]].

For example = In Left 4 Dead, these would be the standard zombies found everywhere.

Permissions = They have no talents, do not roll dice for attacks or skills. Exceptionally, they may have one magical ability (e.g., exploding upon death).

b. Attributes = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/HP\|HP]] is the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] needed to defeat the extras. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/HP\|HP]] is determined by the narrator (for example, they can roll a luck die).

b. Skills = 2 points (if they have any special ability).

b. Damage = based on how much the character falls short of the challenge level.

#### Unimportant Character

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Character\|Unimportant Character]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Enemy\|Unimportant Enemy]]

What it is = A character stronger than extras. This character doesn’t have a name, just a single title and function.

For example = guards on the castle walls, snow demons, or like the special zombies (Spitter) in Left 4 Dead.

Permissions = One attribute (maximum two) is assigned in which points can be placed (e.g., only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]). Additionally, a talent or specialization is determined, and the character receives the same number of points in it as in the main [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]]. The number of points a character can get is determined by their level or by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

b. Attributes = Determined by level. Points can be placed in one or a maximum of two Attributes (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2 or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 1). If an odd number of points, the first attribute gets more points. There can also be characters with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attributes.

b. Skills = The character has one [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] - but no points in skills. The number of points in talent and specialization is determined by level.

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

#### Supporting Character

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Supporting Character\|Supporting Character]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Supporting Enemy\|Supporting Enemy]]

What it is = A character that serves one or two functions in the story. They can also be a stronger version of an "unimportant character."

For example = A merchant who sells items and also gives quests to characters. Or like the strong special zombies (Witch) in Left 4 Dead.

Permissions = They can use attributes, skills, talents, and all points (e.g., wealth). These attributes, etc., are at the level required by the story. Their level of points does not change much during the story. So a poor merchant will ultimately remain poor, even if the player brings them a ton of gold.

b. Attributes = 1 point

b. Skills = 6 points

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]] or by the weapon used.

#### Important Character
[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Important Character\|Important Character]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Important Enemy\|Important Enemy]]

What it is = A character who plays a major role in the story (but not as significant as the main hero). They could be a helper, friend, or teacher of the main character.

For example = Yennefer or Marigold (Dandelion) from The Witcher series, or Legolas from The Lord of the Rings.

Permissions = All their points are at the level required by the story (this level mostly remains unchanged – for example, the poor remain poor).

Gets b. Attributes = 1 point

Gets b. Skills = 8 points

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the weapon used and specialization.

#### Main Hero
[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Main Hero\|Main Hero]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Main Enemy\|Main Enemy]]

What it is =
- A character controlled by a player,    
- or (in case of enemy) a character controlled by the narrator who does everything against the main hero controlled by the player.    

For example = Gordon Freeman, Geralt of Rivia, Sauron.

Permissions = Points can be invested in all attributes, skills. They can use all points (speed, wealth, etc.). They can do anything permitted by the narrator (or agreed upon). They might be exempt from some world or societal rules.

Gets b. Attributes = 3 points

Gets b. Skills = 12 points

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the weapon used and specialization.

#### Divine Character
[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Demi-God Character\|Demi-God Character]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/God Character\|God Character]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Uber-God Character\|Uber-God Character]]  

What it is = A character never controlled by the narrator but important to the story. This character controls other characters "behind the scenes," influences events in the world, or creates new obstacles for the characters. This character is secret and can only be met by other characters when the divine character wants them to.

- Semi-divine characters appear most frequently in the story from this group. Often as some rulers or as servants of divine characters.    
- Divine characters appear much less frequently in the story. But they are also rulers who rule over everyone and cause great change when they intervene in the story.    
- Uber-divine characters are completely hidden, characters see them only when the uber-gods want. They can make massive changes in the story.    

For example = G-Man, Zeus, [[MON\|MON]] and the like.

Permissions = They do what the story requires. These characters cannot be killed but can be defeated and disappear for some time.

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the narrator.
