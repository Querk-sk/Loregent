##### The size of the character

The size of the character determines how quickly and stealthily the character moves. These rules about character size can also be applied during [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], or when players face challenges (where they have to roll a skill, such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]], to pass unnoticed). The character's size also affects the size of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Inventory\|Inventory]].
