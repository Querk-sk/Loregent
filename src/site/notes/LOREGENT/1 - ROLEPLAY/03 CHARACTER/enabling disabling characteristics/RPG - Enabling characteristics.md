### Enabling characteristics

Some characters may have an enhancement that gives them an advantage. This can be a health-related, psychological, or social advantage. Alternatively, a character may excel in something or be particularly successful in a specific area. In our RPG system, all of these aspects are represented by a mechanic called [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]].

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]] is a set of traits that give a character an advantage. They enhance them in some way or help them handle situations that come their way (narrator). Advantages are given to characters to make them interesting. This mechanic, of course, also impacts gameplay (adding or subtracting points) and the story (players portray their character according to their disadvantage, like actors in a film).

A player can take a maximum of **2 Advantages**, each of which must be approved by the narrator and may also be modified if necessary. If the story (and the narrator) permits, an advantage can also be removed over time.

#### How to create an advantage

Below in this text is a list of advantages we have prepared for you. But if you want to create your own, you can proceed as follows.:

##### Impact on the story

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]] must improve a character in some way or help them overcome an obstacle. Therefore, they should be chosen based on what is in the story. If it is a story with magic, the character may have some kind of talent for magic (especially the most common one).

Sometimes a character may need to activate their ability. When the character reaches a place where there is an obstacle (such as when a character knows how to work with cats and is faced with a guard who is a cat), they must roll the dice against the difficulty level. If the character overcomes the difficulty, the ability is activated. If the character fails the dice roll, something bad will happen, or nothing will happen (the ability will not be activated).

If a character wants to activate their ability, they must roll a skill, or they can roll all attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]) without a skill.

##### Impact on Points

The character loses as many points (for skills, talents, or specializations) as the chosen advantage adds. However, for each advantage, every character loses some points (those for skills, talents, and specializations). Additionally, the character loses extra points for each added point to a skill or talent (the list is copied from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]).

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the challenge level by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

    - To determine the quality of the service, luck is rolled. Contacts always fulfill what the character wants from them. But in case of bad luck, it can be more expensive, take longer, or not be without some problems (for example, the character has to break into somewhere).

    - For example, if they have the disadvantage of "cultural ignorance," other characters might consider them harmless. Therefore, they can get into places they normally wouldn't. Or if they don't know the language, people might talk about secret things in front of them. The character doesn't understand, but they might have a recording device.        
- **Points**:
