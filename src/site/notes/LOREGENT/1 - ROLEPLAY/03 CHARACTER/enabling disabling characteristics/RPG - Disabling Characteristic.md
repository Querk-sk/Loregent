### Disabling Characteristic

Every character has some sort of problem that puts them at a disadvantage. Every character has their own difficulties, whether health-related, psychological, or social. Or, a character might be bad at something or just not good at something. All these mentioned difficulties are manifested in our RPG system by a mechanic called "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|Disabling Characteristic]]."

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|Disabling Characteristic]] is a set of traits that put the character at a disadvantage. It limits them in some way, making it difficult for them to solve situations that the story (narrator) throws their way. Disadvantages are given to characters to make them interesting. This mechanic, of course, also affects gameplay (adding or subtracting points) and the story (players play their character according to their disadvantage, like actors in a film).

A character can have a maximum of **2 disadvantages**, each of which must be approved by the narrator and possibly adjusted. If the story (and narrator) allows it, the disadvantage can be erased over time.

#### How to Create a Disadvantage

Below is a list of pre-made disadvantages for you. But if you want to create your own, follow these steps:

##### Impact on the Story

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|Disabling Characteristic]] should create a significant obstacle for the character. It should be chosen based on what’s in the story. If it’s a story with magic, the character might have an allergy to a particular type of magic (especially the most common one).

When the character encounters an obstacle (e.g., phobia of cats and enters a cat café), they must roll dice against the challenge level. If the character overcomes the challenge, nothing bad happens. If they fail the roll, something negative occurs (what happens must be specified for the disadvantage. For example, with a cat phobia, the character might flee or go into a frenzy trying to kill all the cats).

If the character wants to overcome the obstacle (e.g., phobia of cats), they must roll a skill or can roll all attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]) without a skill.

##### Impact on Points

For each disadvantage, the character gets a few extra points, which they can invest in other skills, talents, or specializations. Additional "skill" points can be gained for each point taken by the disadvantage (e.g., if they have a disadvantage giving -2 to the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], they add +2 points.). The point cost is determined by the rules on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]].

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the challenge level by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

>[!example]
>Asthmatic = minus 1 to the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]]. In a dusty environment, the character must roll "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]" against a challenge determined by the narrator (minimum 2). If they fail the roll, they lose 3 dice on each roll unless they use an asthma inhaler. The character receives +4 points to invest in any skill, talent, or specialization.

##### Column - 1 -

###### Item 1 - Advantage hides disadvantage:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character has an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|advantage]], but that advantage comes with a significant downside. It’s a catch that makes using that advantage unpleasant. The narrator decides which advantage it applies to.        
    - For example, the character has a powerful weapon BUT very little ammunition. The character has telepathic abilities BUT using them causes migraines for others. Someone can help the character BUT they have a contagious airborne disease, or the character must cleanse themselves because they bear some societal sin.        
- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

###### Item 2 - Incompatibility with atmosphere:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character is sensitive to something that normally occurs in the air of the given world. They must protect themselves against it. If they don’t (e.g., lack a gas mask), they start suffocating. In contact with the atmosphere they’re sensitive to, the character gains the status “poison.”        
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Poison: The character loses 0.5 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health points]] per round.        
- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

###### Item 3 - Overconfident:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character is overly confident and believes they can solve any problem with 300% certainty.        
    - If the character's primary trait is [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]], they will always think they can solve everything with this skill and will only succeed. When a problem arises, the character is the first to volunteer to solve it, and they may only fail.        
    - Minus 2 points to a skill or talent chosen by the player. No points can be invested in this skill or talent. Points gained from the minus 2 can be invested in other skills or talents.        
    - The character always wants to perform the activity or talent mentioned.        
- **Change**:    
    - Skills : [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]: +2

They cannot roll for defense against [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute (i.e., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intuition\|Intuition]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intimidation\|Intimidation]]). 
- **Change**:

- **Points** : 
	- The character gets 6 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.
	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 6 - Nutritional need:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character must eat to survive or avoid weakness, but it’s something that people don’t normally eat. This thing is considered evil, unclean, or demonic – and everyone condemns the character for it (or it must be kept secret, or they'll be killed). It could be blood, human flesh, etc. The character loses 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|energy]] point every day. Whenever they eat, they regain all [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]].

- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 1 - Weak:

    - Skills: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]: -1        
- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 4 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.        
    - No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 2 - Kleptomania:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character feels the need to steal something. It doesn’t matter what the item's value or significance is. Most items kleptomaniacs steal are useless and not highly valued. They’re mainly after the thrill – the excitement of possibly getting caught or successfully stealing something right under someone’s nose.        
    - When the narrator decides, the character must roll all attributes against a challenge level determined by the narrator. If they fail, the character must steal something (a luck die is rolled to determine what exactly – but something in the vicinity).        
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Not Trusted: Those who know this character are aware they steal. Hence, they don’t let them into stores or always keep an eye on them. With this status, the character gets -3 to the skill [Stealth].        
    - Skills:
		- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]]: 2

	- The character gets 1 extra point, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.
	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 3 - Can't Lie:

- **Explanation**:    
    - This character can't lie, either to everyone or only to certain groups of people (e.g., only to women, or only to their boss). This character always answers when asked. This, of course, doesn’t mean they can’t just tell part of the truth.        
        - For example: Did you fix the hose on the engine?            
        - Yes. (but the engine still doesn’t work)            
    - When the narrator says, the character must roll all attributes against a challenge level set by the narrator. If they fail, the character must reveal the secret.

- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 5 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.        
    - No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 4 - Procrastination:

- **Explanation**:    
    - If there’s a simpler and more enjoyable option, the character will take it. For example, instead of studying, they’ll play video games. The character then feels depressed about not controlling themselves and not doing what they were supposed to. The type of procrastination is determined by the narrator. If the character has something to do, and there are video games nearby, they must maintain focus by rolling all attributes against a challenge level set by the narrator. If they fail, they have to play or lose 3 dice on each roll until they do.        
- **Change**:    
    - Trait: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Needs\|Needs]]: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Gluttony\|Gluttony]]

    - (status) Perfectionist’s Failure: -3 dice on the roll if the character failed the previous roll and it was related to something the character cared about.        
- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.        
    - No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 6 - Achilles' Heel:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character has a weakness that completely "shuts them down," like Superman with kryptonite. They might "hate" having someone aim at their head, or become weak and faint when entering a tavern.        
- **Change**:    
    - (status) Weakness: When the character is under the influence of their weakness, they can only roll 3 dice and do not get any extra dice for their roll.        
- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 2 - Paranoia:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character believes in conspiracies. They are convinced that everyone is against them and wants to harm them. They might believe in "common conspiracies" or complete absurdities. For example, that shoes are disguised aliens, and when someone wears shoes, the aliens control them. The "mission" of this character is to destroy every shoe and cut off the feet of the "infected."        
- **Change**:    
    - Skills:
		- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]]: 1

###### Item 4 - Sociopathy:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character doesn’t know how to interact with others. It’s not that they don’t try; they just don't know how to be human. They’re like a cold stone. They have trouble with physical touch (not knowing when and how to use it). They don’t react to criticism or reproach at all or only like a robot. They can’t empathize with others’ emotions (e.g., when someone cries because they lost a loved one, they can't understand it). They only use facts.

    - Skill: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]: +2        
    - Trait: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Friendliness\|Friendliness]]: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Unfriendly\|Unfriendly]]

###### Item 3 - Delusion:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character has an imaginary friend, sees ghosts (in a world where ghosts don’t exist), or believes they are a wizard and sees everything as a fantasy world (even though it’s a normal world). They believe in fairy tales and do everything as if it worked like a story – because in the story, it must work that way in the real world too.        
    - If it’s a fantasy story – it should be based on the tales and stories told to children "there." What the character believes is never real.    
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Not Trusted: Characters who know this character know they’re lying. Therefore, they lose 3 dice from all [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] skills.        
    - Trait: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Lives In\|Lives In]]: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Fantasy\|Fantasy]]

    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

###### Item 4 - Eccentricity:

- **Explanation**:    
    - A peculiar character, sort of like Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean. They say strange things, do strange things, and have odd habits.        
    - For example, they must always have a scarf on their head, always move their hands when persuading someone, or talk like a pirate – even if they aren’t one.        
    - But the character isn’t demented or evil – they’re just very odd.        
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Not Trusted: Characters who know this character know they’re lying. Therefore, they lose 3 dice from all [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] skills.

	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 5 - Pacifist:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character avoids any aggressive action, and fighting is their last resort. They want to resolve things diplomatically – by talking to everyone and trying to fix the situation as much as possible once they understand what happened.        
    - They refuse to kill anyone. If they have to perform an action that would result in injuring another character, they try to avert it, come up with an alternative, or refuse to do it.        
    - In a successful combat roll, the character uses only pacifist options. They cannot kill the opponent (and can only cause very slight injury).        
- **Change**:    
    - Trait: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Friendliness\|Friendliness]]: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Friendly\|Friendly]]        
- **Points**:

    - During the game, the narrator can roll for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|luck]] to see if the enemies happen to appear. Whenever they find the character, they start attacking or causing harm in some other way. This could be an individual, a small group, or a large organization.        
- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

##### Column - 5 -

###### Item 1 - Phobia:

- **Explanation**:    
    - An overwhelming fear of something.        
    - For example, the character is afraid of spiders, and if they are in a room with spiders, they will either leave or not go in at all. They lose 3 dice on a roll when the source of the phobia is nearby (or when they think it is).        
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Flee: When the character is close to the source of their phobia (or thinks they are), they must roll all attributes against a challenge level set by the narrator. If they fail, they run away – far away.

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character forgets things. They might forget they have an item in their pocket. They might forget a shopping list (and buy something else instead).
    - They often get lost (forget where they are) -> they know the name of the city or street they need to get to but forget where they are.   
    - This forgetfulness doesn’t mean the character has Alzheimer’s – they don’t forget everything. It just means they forget certain things. 
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Forgetfulness: When the narrator says, the character must roll all attributes against a challenge level set by the narrator. If they fail, they forget something really important. To remember where they lost the item, they must roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] against the challenge level set by the narrator.  
    - Skills:        
        - Skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] must be 0

###### Item 4 - Has Child:

    - The character takes care of a small child aged 0-4. They need to ensure the child doesn't cry, has food, and stays warm. The narrator decides when to roll the dice for the child's status (such as illness, crying, or when the child says something they shouldn’t if they are older). The character is attached to the child and considers it their main priority.        
- **Change**:    
    - Skills:
		- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]: 1

###### Item 5 - Allergy:

- **Explanation**:

###### Item 6 - Debt:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character owes money to someone dangerous, like a drug lord who sends dangerous people after them to collect. It’s a large sum, and the character struggles to even pay the interest.        
    - Alternatively, the character belongs to a religious sect where they own nothing and borrow everything (e.g., tools they need). When returning the tool, they must also give something extra back.        
    - The character must pay interest every month. Each time they pay the interest, they lose 40 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]. If they don’t pay, they receive a severe punishment.

    - Trait: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Trust in others\|Trust in others]]: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Paranoia\|Paranoia]]

	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 2 - Nihilism:

- **Explanation**:
	- The character believes there’s no point in resisting things that will happen anyway. They are sad, passive, and talk about death as if they were talking about candy. This doesn't mean they don’t do what they have to; rather, they see no point and don’t give it their all. They always see the world as it is. They can’t be given hope or deceived into thinking things will get better. 
	    - We’re all going to die one day, so why resist?        
	    - It's futile to strive to change these circumstances.
	    - All religions lie, and nothing really has meaning.

	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 3 - Big Child:

- - **Explanation**:    
    - The character is naive, believes everything everyone says or only believes specific people, like their father. They can’t maintain focus for long, are sensitive to cold, fatigue, etc., and whine if their needs aren’t met (e.g., they want to sleep but have to guard the stupid fire).        
    - They do things their own way (even if they’re supposed to watch the fire, they will sleep “just because”).        
    - They act spitefully towards others if they’re upset and choose friends or enemies based on superficial traits (e.g., he raised his voice at me because the fire went out, so I’m not friends with him).        
    - It’s essentially a spoiled child.        
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Childish: When the narrator says, the character must roll all attributes against a challenge level set by the narrator. If they fail, the character behaves childishly or completely contrary to what other characters want.        
    - Skills:
		- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]: -1
		- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]]: -1
		- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]: -1

If they need the medication and don't take it within an hour, their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] decrease by 1 (no more) and will continue to decrease by 1 each hour until they take the medication. Once they take the medication, only 1 health point is restored. Other health points must be restored through [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health\|healing]].

	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 5 - Liar:

- **Explanation**:    
    - This character lies almost all the time, but they shouldn't lie _about everything_ to the point where it’s impossible to maintain a normal conversation or collaboration.        
    - The lies should be about their achievements or things they found. They might say they found a gold coin on the ground or make up amazing stories about how they defeated a dragon—even though they were the first to run away.        
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Not Trusted: Characters who know this character know they’re lying. Therefore, they lose 3 dice from all [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] skills.

    - The character gets 1 bonus point.        
    - Points gained from negatives can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

###### Item 6 - Employment:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character has a job that requires time, focus, and energy. Therefore, they can't go on adventures “just like that” and must also work.        
    - Alternatively, the expedition the character is on is part of their job and has a strict schedule they must follow. They must bring results, or else they don’t get paid. The character has very limited time.        
    - For example, they might only be free after 5 PM and need to go to bed by 8 PM to get up at 5 AM, or they might need to be somewhere to analyze data or conduct excavations.        
    - The character receives a salary of 5 wealth points per week or may not have to pay some fees because the company they work for covers them.        
- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.
