### Luck dice roll

Luck changes the current situation either for the better or for the worse. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] refers to what is happening around the character at that moment. Therefore, it can only affect the "now," at the place where the character is standing, or for approximately one hour. A luck roll made by a character in the middle of the game cannot change the end of the game, nor can its result appear six months later.

A luck roll is used when:

1. The character wants to determine if they will have luck in finding something (They need gasoline - they go to an abandoned gas station and roll for luck to see if there is any).
2. The character wants to determine if the change that just occurred will worsen or improve their situation (It starts raining - will it be a heavy rain or just a drizzle? Will it be thick rain that reduces visibility for the enemy or the character?).
3. Something happens and the character needs to react quickly (This determines the challenge level for solving the problem, for example, how many rounds they have to disarm a bomb).
4. The character finds a shop. Whether it will have everything they need and at what price (for example, the shop could be very expensive or it might not have what they are looking for).
5. The character is under attack - the dice determine the enemy's strength (for example, whether the enemy will have strong weapon and armor).
6. The narrator wants to change the story (The characters will travel to another city for a week. The narrator rolls the dice - if it results in luck - the characters find a treasure map, if it results in misfortune - the characters are attacked by bandits).

If the narrator wants, they can use the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter\|random encounter]] table to spice up the game, they don't have to rely solely on the luck rule.

#### Result of the Luck Roll and What It Means

Luck is rolled with a standard 6-sided die. In this case, it is as follows:

1. Great misfortune
2. Major misfortune
3. Minor misfortune
4. Minor fortune
5. Major fortune
6. Great fortune

##### 1. Great Misfortune

The greatest misfortune possible. It's as if all of Murphy's laws combined to cause harm.

 > [!example]
 > The character is going through a tunnel. They come across a secret door they want to open. They roll for luck to see what awaits them. They roll a 1. Behind the door is a secret enemy base and fully armed. By opening the door, character just triggered the alarm.

Other possibilities for Great Misfortune:

- The character is searching for something    
    - The character doesn't find the item.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but using it increases the challenge level by 2 in every dice roll.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but in order to use it, they must solve a problem with a challenge level of 3.        
- Challenge Level    
    - The challenge level is 6, or CL +3.        
- Possibilities    
    - Among all the possibilities the narrator considers, this is the worst one. Much worse than intended.        
- Random Encounter / Weather    
    - The situation worsens by 200%, or adds an obstacle that must be solved with a skill roll of challenge level 5.

- How many rounds will the bad thing last?    
    - 6 rounds (e.g., if it's burning, the character is poisoned, or an animal goes berserk, it takes 6 rounds to calm down.)        
- Random Encounter    
    - Adds an extra obstacle that must be solved with a skill roll of challenge level 6.        
- Enemy    
    - Level 6        
    - The enemy or enemy group collectively has 6 points in attributes

	    - (6 points = e.g., STR 3 REF 3, or STR 6). In skills, specialization, or spells, they have 6 points (e.g., Perception 6, or Perception 3 and Samurai 3).

    - The minimum price of an item is 6, or +3 to the character's disadvantage.        
    - If the character is selling something, the maximum price of the item is 1, or -3 from the price to the character's disadvantage.        
- Shop (Inventory)

- Story Spice-up    
    - Situation worsens by 200%.        
    - Characters are attacked, find a fake treasure map leading to a trap, follow a false trail returning them to the start, or face a major caravan disaster.        
- Disasters    
    - A large-scale disaster occurs near the character. It could be a few meters from where they stand or close family (e.g., spouse).        
- Services    
    - Only one service is available and it's poor quality.        
- Spell Failure    
    - Wizard is damaged by 3 HP, or : cannot cast spells for 3 days, major enemy enhancement, destruction of a magical item, room destruction.        
- Bad Potion or Medicine Effect    
    - The complete opposite of the potion's intended effect happens, and of course to the character's detriment.

##### 2. Major Misfortune

What wasn't supposed to go wrong, went wrong, or a coincidence worsened the current situation by about 100%.

> [!example]
> The character is going through a tunnel. They come across a secret door they want to open. They roll for luck to see what awaits them. They roll a 2.
