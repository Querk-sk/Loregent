### Dice in general

When a player decides they want to do something in the story, they must determine whether they will succeed or not. This is done using six-sided dice (D6). The player rolls them, and based on the result, the narrator decides success or failure of the intended action.

- If a **1, 2, or 3** appears on the die, it is a failure for that dice.    
- If a **4, 5, or 6** appears on the die, it is a success for that dice.

Failed dice are ignored. Only the rolls with successes are counted, and each success is counted as one piece. The number on the die is ignored—4, 5, or 6 is the same success. To surpass the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]], the player must roll enough successes—more or equal to the challenge level.

> [!example]
> 
> - A character wants to climb over a fence secretly so that no one notices.
> - The narrator assigns a challenge level of 3 because it's harder than a normal fence climb.
> 
> - The character rolls dice and needs to roll 3 successes.
> -  If they roll 3 successes, they climb over the fence.
> - If they roll 2, 1, or 0 successes, they won't climb over the fence, or they fall from it, or knock something off the fence, making noise and alerting all the guards nearby.

The number of dice a character can roll is determined by their attribute and skill points. For each point in an attribute or skill, the character gets one extra die. For each minus in an attribute or skill, the character loses one die.

#### How Many Dice Can I Use for a Roll?

1. Each character or enemy gets 3 dice for each roll.
2. Additional dice are given for each point invested in the used skill (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] +1).
3. Additional dice are given for each point in the main [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]] that enhances used skill (e.g., for the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], it's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]).
4. Additional dice are given for each point invested in a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] that can be used to solve the problem. If the character doesn't have the talent but the situation requires it, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].
5. Additional dice are given for items the character has (e.g., glasses +1).
6. Additional dice are given for circumstances (e.g., it's foggy).

> [!example]
> * A character wants to open a chest without a key – using lockpicking.
> * The character has: 2 points in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]" and 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] is a supplementary attribute for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]).
> * The character gets 3 dice as a base + 2 dice from the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]" + 1 die from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].
> * The character can use 6 dice for their roll.

> [!example]
> * A character wants to convince a merchant that the samurai sword he wants to sell is much rarer than it actually is.
> * The character has: +3 in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]", +2 in the samurai [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] (because he is selling a samurai sword), and 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] is a supplementary attribute for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]).
> * The character gets 3 dice as a base + 3 dice from the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]" + 2 dice from the samurai [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] + 1 die from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]].
> * The character can use 9 dice for their roll.

Each character gets at least 1 die for their roll, even if they have a lot of minuses (e.g., from injury or circumstances).
