### Quick check - dice roll

In the story, there might be situations where a character needs to quickly react to a danger that could cause injury or death. In these situations, the narrator will tell, which skill the character must roll. For every point the character misses the challenge level, they lose that many [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]. After successful Quick Check, the character does not receive any success or dice for the next roll.

>- The character is falling from a great height.
>- The narrator says they must roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]" against a CL of 4.
>- Let's say the character rolls with 6 dice and gets 3 success.
>- They missed the CL by 1, so they take 1 injury (i.e., -1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]).

> - The character is driving and another car is rushing towards them
> - The narrator says they must roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatnÃ©/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]]" to avoid the car.

If the narrator doesn't know what difficulty to assign to a quick action, they can roll for luck, with the following results:

1. Great misfortune = CL 6 or CL 3 + the CL the narrator wanted
2. Major misfortune = CL 5 or CL 2 + the CL the narrator wanted
3. Minor misfortune = CL 4 or CL 1 + the CL the narrator wanted
4. Minor fortune = CL 3 or CL 1 - the CL the narrator wanted
5. Major fortune = CL 2 or CL 2 - the CL the narrator wanted
6. Great fortune = CL 1 or CL 3 - the CL the narrator wanted
