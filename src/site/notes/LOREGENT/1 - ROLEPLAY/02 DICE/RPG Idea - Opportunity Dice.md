### Opportunity Dice

> A bomb is ticking as the hero stairs into a mess of wires . . .

>The explorers hear the giant ape stir, and are relieved when he falls asleep again . . 

>Thieves slink in the shadows, not knowing how much time until the guard returns . ..

Many of the best moments of fiction happen when the heroes must operate under intense time pressure. **Opportunity Dice** allows you to simulate that time pressure for your players, so they are forced to make Risk vs Reward decisions with imperfect information.

#### Opportunity Dice – Core Rules

1. Pick a starting number of **Opportunity Dice**. 12 (recommended), 16, or 18 (fairly easy) should be suitable for most purposes.  
2. Gameplay is in rounds, even if the players are not in combat. After each player has moved (if desired) and taken a round’s worth of actions, the **Opportunity Dice Pool** is rolled.
3. On 1-3 the d6 is removed from the _Opportunity Dice Pool_. On 4-5, the d6 remains in the pool. On a 6 a d6 is added back.
4. If all _Opportunity Dice_ are removed from the _Opportunity Dice Pool_, a **Consequence** occurs.   
#### In Life, There are Consequences

A good **Consequence**

- Has serious narrative weight, and is bad for the party (though crisis can sometimes bring its own opportunities)    
- But, it doesn’t automatically result in the player character's death or end the story.   

So let’s say the Opportunity Dice represents the players racing against a ticking time bomb. The party is a party of superheroes; the ticking bomb might not kill them, but it might kill NPCs and earn the superheroes a bad rap.

Or if the party are (standard) humans, it may be good to have the bomb placed so it destroys the starship the players are in, but in a way that the players survive. The ship and its cargo are lost, but the players will likely be able to be pulled from the wreckage.

#### Buying Time

If a player has a way to give the party more time, their action is determined to fit into one of two categories – actions that **Slow Opportunity Loss** and actions that **Reverse Opportunity Loss**.

#### Reversing Opportunity Loss

Let’s take the scenario of sneaking past the sleeping giant ape. One of the characters, a wizard, says they want to use an enchanted song to lull the ape back to sleep, using their Enchanter vocation. They have 8d6 in their Enchanter pool and they make a roll against Challenge Level 3 and get six successes. Each success above 3 (three successes in this case), represents a d6 that gets added to the _Opportunity Dice Pool._

So, to **Reverse Opportunity Loss:**

1. The character takes an action that proactively improves the situation.    
2. They make a roll using their _Skill_ or _Vocation_ against Challenge Level 3   
3. Every success above 3 is a d6 returned to the _Opportunity Dice Pool._ 

#### Slowing Opportunity Loss

Let’s say one party member sneaking past that giant ape has a craftsperson vocation. They tell the GM they want to quickly cut padded bottoms for everyone’s shoes from some leather they have on hand.

The GM sets a difficulty of 3 and the player passes. Given that their feet are quieter, the GM rules that the noise disturbs the giant ape less. As such the _Opportunity Rolls_ are going to be **Favorable**

When Opportunity Rolls are **Favorable**, dice are lost on 1-2, kept on 3-5, and regained on 6.

Opposing characters may make checks to try and make the Opportunity Loss **Standard** again or **Unfavorable** (dice lost 1-4, kept on 5 regained on 6).

So, to **Slow Opportunity Loss:**

1. The character takes an action that diminishes or slows the loss of _Opportunity_ but doesn’t improve the situation.    
2. They make a roll using their _Skill_ or _Vocation_ against Challenge Level 3   
3. If they succeed, they create a _Favorable_ situation that allows all Opportunity Rolls to be Favorable until such time as a narrative event or opposing NPC removes the _Favorable_ condition.

### TAG and LINK : 

##### My Solution
- - Create timed events (e.g., the bomb explodes after 3 rounds) or segmented events (e.g., first you have to cut the wires, then remove the board, and then cut something else).
