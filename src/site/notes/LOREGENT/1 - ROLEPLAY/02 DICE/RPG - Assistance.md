### Assistance â€“ dice roll

Assistance is a special dice roll where multiple characters join together to help each other. One character can help another, for example, with fixing a car, or they go together to break down doors and so on.

Assistance works the same way as the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Success and Failure#Transfer of Successes\|Transfer of Successes]]. So characters roll the same dice with the same skills against the same challenge level. When characters surpass the challenge level, they transfer their successes (those above the level) to the character they are assisting. This also means that if the helping characters fail the roll, nothing is transferred (and nothing is reduced). Similarly, nothing is transferred when the helping characters reach the challenge level. They must exceed it.

> [!example]
> * Character 1 wants to break down a door. 
> * Character 2 decides to help them.
>  <br>
> * Character 1 will roll, for example, with 5 dice against a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] of 3
> * Helping Character can roll with 6 dice against [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] 3
> <br>
> * Character 1 rolls, for example, 2 successes
> * Helping Character rolls, for example, 4 successes. They can transfer 1 success ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] 3 - 4 successes)
> <br>
> * 1 success is transferred to Character 1, allowing them to surpass the challenge level. And the characters break down the door together.

The character (who wants to help) must ask the narrator if they can help the other character. When the narrator agrees, the "helper" will roll dice with the same skill as the character. They can also use a talent if it applies to the problem (for example, the pyrotechnics [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] to defuse a bomb). The base challenge level for assistance is the same as the challenge level of the activity being assisted. When a character assists an activity that requires a talent and the assisting character does not have that [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]], they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

Multiple characters can help one character. However, if it's a roll where characters can get hurt and the characters fail, all characters (including those who helped) will receive the same damage as the character being helped, though the damage is reduced by armor for each character separately.

Assistance cannot be used on an assistance roll that is meant to assist something. It can only be used once and on the final roll. If a character is performing something difficult or time-consuming, they cannot participate in assistance. Other characters must wait until it is completed.
