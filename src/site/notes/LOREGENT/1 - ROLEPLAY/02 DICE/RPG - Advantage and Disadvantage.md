### Advantage and Disadvantage

#### Advantage

When the narrator decides that fate favors the character, or the character has a favorable position, or the character decides to use 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]. In this case, the win threshold shifts in favor of the character. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1 or 2**, it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of Advantage)    
- If the die rolls a **3, 4, 5, or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of Advantage)

#### Great Advantage

It works the same way as advantage. It is used when one character in a fight has equipment like from the Middle Ages and the other has equipment from the distant future, or when the character decides to use 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]. In this case, the win threshold shifts in favor of the character. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1**, it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of great Advantage)    
- If the die rolls a **2, 3, 4, 5, or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of great Advantage)

#### Disadvantage

When the narrator decides that fate is not in the character's favor, or the character has an unfavorable position. Or when the character lacks a talent and the situation requires that talent. Or when the character lacks specialization (or talent) for a weapon and the weapon requires specialization. Or when the character decides to restore 1 used [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. In this case, the win threshold may shift against the player. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1, 2, 3, or 4,** it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of Disadvantage)  
- If the die rolls a **5 or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of Disadvantage)

#### Great Disadvantage

It works the same way as disadvantage. It is used when a character lacks talent or specialization for magic and intends to use magic. Or when a character lacks a talent required for the situation, and the solution to the situation is very complex even for someone with education. Or when a character lacks specialization (or talent) for a weapon, and the weapon requires specialization, especially if it is a very complex weapon. Or when the character decides to restore 2 used [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. In this case, the win threshold may shift against the player. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1, 2, 3, 4, or 5,** it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of great Disadvantage)    
- If the die rolls a **6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of great Disadvantage)
