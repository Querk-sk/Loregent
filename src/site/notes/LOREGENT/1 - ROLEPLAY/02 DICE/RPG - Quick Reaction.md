### Quick Reaction - Dice roll

In the story, there may be a situation where a character wants to act immediately, but cannot because they are doing something else, carrying a heavy backpack, and the situation has "escalated quickly".

If the character wants to react immediately - they must roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]" against the challenge level determined by the narrator. If they pass the challenge level, they can react immediately and continue with another skill or roll. (For example, if they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] and pass the challenge level, they can immediately roll a combat roll.)

If the character does not pass the challenge level, they must wait an extra round (or however many rounds they missed the challenge level by).

The character does not receive any success or dice for the next roll in a quick reaction roll.
