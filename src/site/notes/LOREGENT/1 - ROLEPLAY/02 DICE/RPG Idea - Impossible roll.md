#### Idea - RPG - Impossible roll : 

Impossible roll : If a character wants to do something totally impossible in the story, which goes against the rules of the world, they can make an "impossible roll." The character rolls 10 dice, and all must be successes. The fewer successes from the impossible roll, the greater the punishment the character receives.
