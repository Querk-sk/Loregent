### Chase - dice roll

Chase is rolled when one character tries to escape from another character, or when a character tries to escape from some threat. The narrator determines the moment from which the characters start chasing each other, as well as the distance from which the chase starts (chase may not start from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Chase#Chase and Distance\|medium distance]]). The characters then roll dice against each other, meaning one rolls dice and successes are noted. Then the other rolls dice and successes are noted. And the difference between characters is evaluated.

If the "attacker" (the one chasing) has more successes, the distance between them decreases. If the attacker wins when they are close to their victim, the attacker catches the victim. If the attacker is closer, they can use their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] or luck to stop the victim. They can push their victim against a wall, or even if they are on a horse, they can injure the horse to make the victim fall. When the attacker catches the victim, the attacker gets one advantage - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances#Advantageous position\|better position]].

When the victim wins more often, they distance themselves from the attacker, and if the victim is sufficiently far away, they escape from the attacker.

#### Chase and Distance

* **Close**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, they catch the victim.
        * A combat roll is then made additionally, with the attacker gaining an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances#Advantageous position\|advantage]] to their roll.
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, the distance between them increases to "medium."
* **Medium Distance**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, the distance decreases to "close."
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, the distance increases to "greater."
* **Greater Distance**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, the distance between them decreases to "medium."
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, the distance between them changes to "great distance."
* **Greatest Distance**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, the distance decreases to "greater."
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, they escape from the attacker and the chase ends.

> [!note]
> There is a difference between perceiving closeness and distance â€“ whether the character is in a car, a spaceship, or running on foot or on a horse. The distance is determined by the narrator.

#### How to Roll for Chase?

When a character is running - they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] skill. If a significant obstacle (such as a car) appears, it is necessary to make a skill check, for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], or any other appropriate skill before the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] roll. When a character is riding a horse or driving a car - they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - others/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]]. If an obstacle appears, it is necessary to make a check, for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], before driving, so the character notices the obstacle and can react better to it.
