### Random World

The narrator might find themselves needing to quickly create a new world or at least its dimension. If they're unsure about how exactly the world should function or look, they can use the following rules and tables.

#### Three Story Dice

If the narrator has so-called "story dice," they can use those to build the world. Simply roll 1 to 3 dice for each category (in the list below).

- Dice for the world (what it is, how it looks)    
- Dice for advantages (friends, good things, helpful elements, friendly animals, plants, objects)    
- Dice for disadvantages (enemies, harmful elements, poisonous things)

**The narrator can also roll the dice to determine what the characters need to do to succeed:**

1. Activate a mechanism, repair it, or just find it and understand it
2. Move, push, throw something, or use physical force
3. Attack the enemy, avoid the enemy, or deceive the enemy
4. Think, solve a puzzle, or learn something
5. Overcome fear, break their principles, break the law
6. Swim, cut down a tree, climb a mountain

**The narrator can also decide which element will be present in the given world:**

1. Fire, something hot, in a volcano
2. Water, something cold, underwater
3. Earth, something solid or crystal-related, underground
4. Air, something pressurized (like air pressure), in the sky
5. Electricity, something related to technology, possibly forgotten technology
6. Plants, something related to life, within an organism

**Or, if the narrator doesn't want to choose between elements, they can decide which color of magic will be used in the given world:**

1. Brown = rot, fungi, mold, disease
2. Gray = elements
3. Green = plants
4. Red = organics, body transformation
5. Blue = spirits, soul, psyche
6. White = energy, physical phenomena

**And if the narrator decides to use magic, they can also determine the level of that magic:**

1. Primitive = like the Stone Age
2. Common = at the level we have in our world
3. Exceptional = at the level of our world, but scientists are still working on it
4. Rare = at the level of futurism stories in the not-so-distant future
5. Very rare = at the level of Sci-Fi stories, but something that can still be physically explained
6. Legendary = like fairy tales

**Lastly, the narrator can roll the dice to determine where the characters will start their story in the new world:**

1. By a river, sea, or lake
2. In the mountains, on cliffs, somewhere high
3. In a city, village, or settlement
4. On a road between cities
5. In a meadow, field, or somewhere outside of civilization
6. Deep in a forest or jungle
