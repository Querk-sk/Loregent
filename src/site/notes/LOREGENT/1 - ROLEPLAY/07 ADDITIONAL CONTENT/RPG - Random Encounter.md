#### Enemy Attribute Points

During forest or country travel, characters might be attacked by bandits. To save the narrator from worrying about enemy statistics, they can use this list, which categorizes enemies by complexity (tier). The tier determines the number of attribute points the enemy gets. If the narrator can't decide, they can roll a die (in this case, the tier equals the result minus 1).
  
1. 0 points in attributes or skills and no combat talent. The enemy has no weapon.    
2. 1 point in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 1-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
3. 2 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 2-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
4. 3 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 3-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
5. 4 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 4-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
6. 5 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 5-point weapon or armor (or combination).
