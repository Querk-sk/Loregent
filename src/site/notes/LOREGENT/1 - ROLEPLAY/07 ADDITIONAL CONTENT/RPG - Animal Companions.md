### Animal Companions

Animal companions are beings that assist the character. They can be pets, "friends," "servants," or "golems." The character doesn't directly control them but gives commands that the companions can understand in their own way (according to their intelligence). Communication with animal companions often involves commands (e.g., "sit!"), sounds (e.g., whistling), body language (e.g., extending an arm forward), and similar methods.

Examples of animal companions include:

- **Pets**: cats, dogs, guinea pigs, and similar animals.    
- **Farm Animals**: cows, sheep, ducks, and similar animals.    
- **Transport Animals**: horses, camels, llamas, and similar animals.    
- **Guard Animals**: dogs, wolves, falcons, and similar animals.    
- **Constructed Beings**: golems, elementals, small personal robots    
- And other similar beings.

Animal companions play an essential role in assisting characters in various tasks, providing support, and enriching the storytelling experience.

#### Attributes of Animal Companions

Animal companions in our system are considered Unimportant Characters (the difference is that companions can have names).

#### Unimportant Character

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Character\|Unimportant Character]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Enemy\|Unimportant Enemy]]

What it is = A character stronger than extras. This character doesn’t have a name, just a single title and function.

For example = guards on the castle walls, snow demons, or like the special zombies (Spitter) in Left 4 Dead.

Permissions = One attribute (maximum two) is assigned in which points can be placed (e.g., only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]). Additionally, a talent or specialization is determined, and the character receives the same number of points in it as in the main [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]]. The number of points a character can get is determined by their level or by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

b. Attributes = Determined by level. Points can be placed in one or a maximum of two Attributes (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2 or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 1). If an odd number of points, the first attribute gets more points. There can also be characters with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attributes.

b. Skills = The character has one [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] - but no points in skills. The number of points in talent and specialization is determined by level.

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].


</div></div>


> [!example]
> - Bear: Level 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]: 3, Talent: forest environment 3, Weapon specialization: hand protectors 3 (its claws).
> - Bear wants to knock down a tree in the forest: gets 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] + Talent
> - Bear wants to knock down a fence in the city: gets 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]

When a companion has to do something (e.g., jump over a fence), it rolls a skill check just like a character. Most dice rolls are the same as for regular characters. The difference is that the number of dice may vary (since companions do not have skill points), and if the companion has a talent for a specific environment (e.g., bear in the forest), it does not get talent dice in other environments. In combat, the companion can use talent or specialization for fighting (the character only gets dice from specialization, not talent).

> [!example]
> - Bear looks for food in the forest: gets 3 + Perception + Talent for forest environment
> - Bear looks for food in the city: gets 3 + Perception (no talent dice, as it's not in the forest).
> - Bear attacks: gets 3 + Attributes (i.e., 3 from STR) + Specialization (3 claws). Maximum damage per round is 3 (since its level is 3).

The animal companion is recorded in the character's inventory, along with all attributes and descriptions. The animal companion does not affect the character's inventory but can be used as a pack animal—considered an external inventory like a treasure chest. The companion's inventory size is determined by its level.

>[!example]
>Bear: level 3 = 3 inventory points. (It's also minus 3 for inventory weight, as the bear has STR 3)

#### Specialization for Controlling Animal Companions

To control an animal companion, a character must have a specialization directly related to that specific companion. This specialization only applies to that particular animal companion and not to another, even if it is the same animal or being.

> [!example]
> A character has a bear named Pooh as their pet. In the character table, they write the specialization "Bear Pooh." This specialization is tied only to "Pooh" and not to another bear.

Specialization is necessary for the character to fully control their companion. Therefore, they must invest points in specialization according to the companion's level.

>[!example]
>- Bear Pooh is level 3. Therefore, the character must have 3 points in their specialization.

When the character has the required number of points to control the companion, they do not need to roll any control checks before the companion's roll—the companion simply rolls their dice.

If the character does not have the required number of points, the companion still rolls their dice, but the number of dice is reduced by the number of points the character lacks in their specialization.

If the character has more points than required, the companion gains extra dice.

> [!example]
>The character wants Bear Pooh to knock down a tree. Bear Pooh is level 3.
>
>If the character has 3 points in their specialization, Bear Pooh rolls the dice (the character does not roll).
>
>If the character has 1 point in their specialization, Bear Pooh rolls the dice (the character does not roll), but loses 2 dice from their roll (because Bear Pooh is level 3 - 1 specialization point = minus 2 dice).
>
>If the character has 4 points in their specialization, Bear Pooh rolls the dice (the character does not roll), but gains 1 extra die (because Bear Pooh is level 3 - 4 specialization points = plus 1 die).

If the companion fails the dice roll, they may misunderstand the command and, for example, attack someone else, knock down the wrong tree, or knock down the tree onto the character.

#### Challenge Level for Controlling an Animal Companion

Each animal companion has its own level (tier) that indicates its strength and abilities. The level of the animal is determined by the following list. (Note: the level of a golem or a being summoned by a spell is determined by the number of successes rolled by the character).

**Size**
- Like a mouse (7 - 12 cm) = level + 0    
- Like a cat (20 cm - 45 cm) = level + 1    
- Like a dog (45 cm - 80 cm) = level + 1    
- Like a lion (100 cm - 200 cm) = level + 2    
- Like a horse (140 cm - 240 cm) = level + 2    
- Like a bear (140 cm - 280 cm) = level + 3    
- Like an elephant (550 cm - 650 cm) = level + 4    
- Larger = level + 5    
- Even larger = level + 6    

**Education**
- Wild = level + 0    
- Domesticated = level + 1    
- Trained = level + 2    
- Professionally trained (e.g., police dog) = level + 3    

**Age**
- Juvenile = level + 0    
- Adult = level + 1    
- Senior = level + 2    

**Magical Properties**
- None = level + 0    
- According to the level of magic
