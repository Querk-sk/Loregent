### Traveling

In every story, characters travel from one place to another. To make this traveling not boring, our RPG system does not use realistic traveling (where the exact distance characters travel is measured), but rather narrative traveling, where the distance is determined by the number of events or problems that the characters experience or need to solve.

#### Distance

Travel distance falls into three categories:

- Close    
- Farther    
- Very Far    

The storyteller does not need to think much about how many kilometers the characters need to travel. It is enough to decide between the three options (listed above). However, if the storyteller wants to determine the distance exactly, they can use the following list as a reference.

### Other Challenge Levels

In this section, there are lists of challenge levels for variables such as distance, height, depth, weight, time, and so on. These lists serve as a guide for the Narrator when they want to determine the challenge level of a journey (when characters are traveling somewhere), the challenge level of a spell (for instance, when a character wants to lift a car with their magic), or the challenge level when characters encounter some danger and need to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|solve the situation quickly]].

#### Narrative distance between two places

This challenge level is used when characters are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Traveling\|traveling]] somewhere, and the Narrator wants to determine how long they will travel or how many events they will experience along the way. It can also be used when they are in a hurry (for instance, when the villain wants to activate a superweapon, and the characters want to stop them) to see if they can make it in time, or when a character is sneaking past guards to see if they go unnoticed.

The narrative distance increases the base challenge level of the character, changes the challenge level for the enemy, or changes the number of rounds during which the enemy can roll dice (for example, the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill when searching for the character).

Below is a list written in kilometers, but it can also be used for other distance units. So, for example, when determining a spaceship jump, it won't be calculated in kilometers but in light-years. And when a character floats in a space station and pushes off with their legs (to travel a distance, for example, from the bridge to the laboratory), it will be calculated in meters, not kilometers.

As for skills, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] is used to overcome distances (if the character is on foot), or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (if they are driving a car), but other skills can also be used as determined by the Narrator (for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] when jumping in a space station or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] when swimming across a river).

##### List of distances

1. Distance 0,5 Km || (15 minutes )
2. Distance 1 Km ||  (30 minutes)
3. Distance 5 Km ||  (1 hours)
4. Distance 10 Km ||  (2 hours)
5. Distance 50 Km || (10 hours)
6. Distance 100 Km || (20 hours)
7. Distance 500 Km || (4 days)
8. Distance 1 000 Km || (8 days)
9. Distance 5 000 Km || (1,5 months)
10. Distance 10 000 Km || (~3 months)
11. Distance 20 000 Km ||  (~6 months)

>[!note]
>- The time written for distances is the time it takes for a person to cover that distance. According to the internet, the walking speed of a person is approximately 5 km per hour.

##### Distance, car and shoes

Objects or machines that accelerate or somehow facilitate movement, reduce the challenge level when covering distances. The exact amount by which they reduce the challenge is determined by the Narrator, as each machine has different movement capabilities.

>[!example]
>
> * Magic Boots of Speed ​​= (minus) 1 ZL
> * Bicycle = (minus) 2 ZL
> * Car = (minus) 3 ZL
> * Single-seat plane = (minus) 6 ZL

The challenge of covering distances is also influenced by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Size of the character\|size of the character]]

##### Distance, terrain, and circumstances

When it comes to distance (whether narrative or combat), the success of overcoming it is influenced by circumstances such as terrain complexity, gravity strength, or thin air.

>[!example] 
>- A strong snowstorm can add a CL +2.
>- A high mountain can add a CL +4

Movement circumstances (whether terrain or weather, and so on) can be applied at any time and as needed. Sometimes the circumstance is so strong that before the main roll, the character must also make a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|skill check]] of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill. For instance, when they are in deep water or flying in low gravity.

##### Change in Movement Speed

The final challenge level (derived from distance) can also change based on how fast the character is moving. For example, when a character is rushing to overtake someone (say, in a race), or when they are slowly sneaking through a garden to avoid guards.

Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Slower movement has the advantage of the character moving much more quietly, but on the other hand, it takes longer. The advantage is that the character's challenge level decreases (for example, when walking through dry leaves), while the disadvantage is that the guards will roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] multiple times in a row. This time disadvantage, however, breaks the rules. Because on one hand, it decreases the challenge level derived from the distance, which on the other hand "kind of" speeds up the character's movement through the terrain - since the challenge level also indicates how quickly the character moves through a given section (for example, at challenge 4 it is about 2 hours, or 4 rounds of rolling dice). So what should the Narrator do?

Well, when a character moves slower, the challenge level decreases when solving problems (i.e., when rolling skills). However, the time is extended. If a character, for example, reduces the challenge by 2 (by moving slowly), their time is extended by 2. So, for a distance of 3, they will have challenges with CL 1, but it will extend their time to 5 ( 10 hours, or 5 rounds of rolling dice ).

* Slowly
	- Description:
		- The character moves slowly, carefully, or quietly.        
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 2 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 2.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance increases by +2.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +2 extra dice rolls.

- Slower    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves slower, more carefully, or more quietly.
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 1 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 1 success, or the CL for the enemy increases by 1.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance increases by +1.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +1 extra dice roll.

- Normal    
	- No changes

- Faster    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves a bit faster, more recklessly, or noisier.
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 1 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 1 success, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 1.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance decreases by 1.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 1 fewer dice roll.

- Even faster    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves even faster, more recklessly, or noisier.     
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 2 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 2.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance decreases by 2.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 2 fewer dice rolls.

>[!example]
The character is sneaking down a corridor with guards. However, they are in a great hurry because the enemy will activate their superweapon in 3 rounds.
>
The character decides to go 'even faster.' Thanks to this, they will overtake the enemy, but on the other hand, the guards may detect the character sooner because, to detect them, they need to overcome a much lower challenge level in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|perception]] rolls.
>
(In this case, it can be that the character rolls [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] and rolls 4 successes. This becomes the challenge level for the guards. They will roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] – but because the character is in a hurry, they only need to overcome CL 2 instead of CL 4.)

#### Narrative Height

Narrative height refers to the height that a character must overcome when jumping somewhere. Narrative height also includes depth when a character is falling from some height. It can also refer to the depth of the sea when a character is swimming in an underwater cave. It can also refer to flight altitude when a character is flying in an airplane. We have summarized all these cases in the following lists, assigning a challenge level to each height (or depth). The lists use challenge levels that have already been adjusted to account for normal human abilities.

However, if a height in the story is not a whole number (e.g., 4.2 m), the number is rounded "up" to determine the challenge level (in the case of 4.2 m, it will be 5 m).

##### Narrative Height

This list of challenges accounts for **jumping up** (when a character jumps somewhere), **jumping down** (when a character jumps into a pit), or even **leaping over** (when a character jumps across a chasm).

1. Height 2 m
2. Height 4 m
3. Height 8 m
4. Height 16 m
5. Height 32 m
6. Height 64 m
7. Height 128 m
8. Height 256 m
9. Height 512 m

##### Narrative Height (flying an airplane)

If a character is flying an airplane (and so on), they need to fly at a certain height above the ground to avoid crashing into a tower or tree. Therefore, the lower they fly (for instance, to avoid radar), the more challenging it will be for them to maneuver without crashing. The list below assumes a character flying a typical light airplane. Therefore, if the character in the story is flying something heavier, the Narrator should adjust this scale accordingly. The heavier the airplane, the higher the challenge at lower altitudes.

1. Height 512 m
2. Height 256 m
3. Height 128 m
4. Height 64 m
5. Height 32 m
6. Height 16 m
7. Height 8 m
8. Height 4 m
9. Height 2 m
10. Height 1 m
11. Height approximately 0 m

##### Narrative Depth

When a character swims in the sea, they swim at a certain depth. The deeper they dive, the more difficult swimming becomes due to increased water pressure and currents that are not present at shallower depths. The scale below reflects this challenge, accounting for a typical character swimming with regular diving equipment. However, if a character is swimming in a submarine (or something that protects them from pressure), like with distances, the machine subtracts some value from the challenge (for example, a personal submarine CL - 8).

1. Depth 2 m
2. Depth 4 m
3. Depth 8 m
4. Depth 16 m
5. Depth 32 m
6. Depth 64 m
7. Depth 128 m
8. Depth 256 m
9. Depth 512 m

#### Narrative Weight

It is used when characters want to lift something or someone, move something, push something. Simply put, they have to exert effort against some weight. Narrative weight has nothing to do with the character's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Inventory\|inventory]] (and the items in it).

Secondly, the challenge of narrative weight is relative. It will be determined differently, for example, in a world full of giants or in an ant world. Therefore, the Narrator must adjust this list (below) according to the story. The lists use challenge levels that have already been adjusted to account for normal human abilities.

0. wt. 5 Kg. (e.g., newborn, vacuum cleaner, watermelon)
1. wt. 10 Kg. (e.g., child, bucket of paint, tire)
2. wt. 20 Kg. (e.g., large bucket of paint, leopard, dumbbells)
3. wt. 40 Kg. (e.g., toilet, washing machine)
4. wt. 80 Kg. (e.g., baby elephant, bags of cement)
5. wt. 160 Kg. (e.g., refrigerator, large piano)
6. wt. 320 Kg. (e.g., deer, compressor, trailer)
7. wt. 640 Kg. (e.g., seven refrigerators, camel)
8. wt. 1 t. (e.g., car, minibus, medium-sized boat)
9. wt. 3 t. (e.g., rhinoceros, small truck, jeep)
10. wt. 5 t. (e.g., tank)
11. wt. 10 t
12. wt. 20 t
13. wt. 41 t
14. wt. 82 t
15. wt. 164 t
16. wt. 328 t
17. wt. 655 t
18. wt. 1 K.t
19. wt. 3 K.t
20. wt. 5 K.t

[Weight of Stuff – We like to weigh stuff so you don't have to](https://weightofstuff.com/)

- ton = 1000 kg
- kilo ton = 1000 t    
- mega ton = 1 million t    
- giga ton = 1 billion t

The challenge level from weight is reduced by objects or machines designed for lifting. The exact reduction must be determined by the Narrator, as each machine has different capabilities. (The list below includes machines or objects that operate in kilograms).

* Magic strength gloves = (minus) 1 CL
* Furniture moving straps = (minus) 2 CL
* Forklift = (minus) 7 CL
* Small crane = (minus) 10 CL

#### Timing of skills

It is used in the story when characters want to lift something and hold it for a certain time (for example, a burning coal, which is part of a courage ritual), or used for spells, for example when a character summons an elemental with a short lifespan.

##### Challenge level and time

0. Minute
1. 30 minutes
2. Hour
3. 12 hours
4. Day
5. 4 days
6. Week
7. 2 weeks
8. Month
9. 3 months
10. Half a year
11. Year
12. Two years
13. Five years
14. Ten years
15. Twenty years
16. etc.

##### CL, Time, and Speeding Up or Slowing Down

When a character needs to, they can speed up their action (e.g., disarming a bomb when there's no time, so they must hurry). Or when doing something complicated and wanting to concentrate - they can "slow down" their action. It's the same rule as with distances and movement speed, just slightly adjusted. Mainly in that for the required time to perform an action, the challenge list from the time is used (as shown above).

- Slowly    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action slowly, carefully, or quietly.   
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 2 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 2.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action increases by +2 (e.g., instead of 1 hour, it will take 1 day).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +2 extra dice rolls.

- Slower    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action slower, more carefully, or more quietly.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 1 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 1.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action increases by +1 (e.g., instead of 1 hour, it will take a few hours).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +1 extra dice roll.

- Normal    
    - No changes

- Faster    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action a bit faster, more recklessly, or noisier.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 1 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 1 success, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 1.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action decreases by 1 (e.g., instead of 1 day, it will take a few hours).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 1 fewer dice roll.

- Even Faster    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action even faster, more recklessly, or noisier.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 2 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 2.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action decreases by 2 (e.g., instead of 1 day, it will take an hour).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 2 fewer dice rolls.

#### Events

Distance only indicates how many events a character (or their entire group) experiences during travel. The number of events can be determined simply or more complexly. The group completes the entire distance once they experience (or solve) all the events that travel brings.

##### Simple Determination of Number of Events

- Close - 1 event    
- Farther - 2 events    
- Very Far - 3 events

##### Complex Determination of Number of Events

When the storyteller uses the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels#List of distances\|distance list]], the number of events the characters experience on the journey can be determined according to this list. The complexity level based on distance can then be used as a number to determine the complexity of all events during the journey. Alternatively, this number can be used to determine the number of event rolls according to the table of randomness. Everything is explained below.

###### Challenge level of Events

The challenge level (CL) based on distance determines the complexity of all events the characters encounter during the journey. This means that if the CL is 6, then the CL of one event will also be 6. However, the storyteller can divide this number into multiple events, for example, the characters experience 3 events, each with a CL of 2.

###### Number of Events

The CL based on distance determines the total number of events the characters encounter during the journey. This means that if the CL is 6, then the number of event rolls according to the tables of randomness will be 6. So the storyteller rolls the dice 6 times and chooses an event according to the tables. They can choose from the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter#Náhodné stretnutie\|random encounters]], a random task according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random conflict#Náhodný konflikt\|random conflicts]], or from the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Story cubes#Príbehové kocky\|story dice]]. They can also determine the weather according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Weather#Náhodné počasie\|random weather]] or the properties of the terrain according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random World#Náhodný svet\|random world]].

##### Note on Number of Events

The storyteller does not need to stick strictly to any numbers during journey planning. If they decide that nothing significant happened during the journey, that is fine. Or if they decide that instead of 6 smaller events, there will be one side quest - that is also fine. The storyteller has complete freedom in how many events to include in the journey and how significant they should be.

#### Types of Events

Each event falls into three categories:

- Combat Event    
- Story Event    
- Exploration Event    
- Mixed Events, which combine the previous ones    
- and Rest Event

##### Combat Event

Combat events may or may not be important for the story. Characters can fight against bandits, animals, or even living plants. It's a good opportunity for the storyteller to show what kinds of monsters exist in the world or what types of dangerous groups there are.

Things in combat events are resolved only through combat or some type of duel.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters has attracted the attention of the main villain, who sent some minions to test their strength.
>- The group of characters encounters someone they have taken money from.
>- The group of characters notices marks on the trees. However, they don't know that this territory belongs to monsters who attack the group because they ignored the warning (not noticing the marks).
>- The characters arrive in a village where the main lord is bored. So the lord organizes a race with obstacles (and monsters).

##### Story Event

In story events, roles are played as if in a theater play. Characters can encounter another character who talks to them and tells them something. Characters can get into negotiations with an enemy or attend a celebration.

Things in story events are mainly resolved through dialogue or by solving puzzles, problems, or mysteries.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters encounters a group of wandering musicians who travel the world and play wherever they are paid. They can exchange stories and important advice.
>- The group of characters comes across a golden carriage guarded by strong knights.
>- It seems that the group of characters has entered a territory where the ghosts of the deceased cannot, well, die, and they remain in this world. The same fate could befall the group unless they solve their problem.
>- The characters find a discreet shop where all items are obviously quite expensive and powerful. But when they ask for the price, the shopkeeper says they'll sell it for "a small favor."

##### Exploration Event

Exploration events reveal more about the place or the overall land where the characters are. They are not in any danger from enemies – the characters need to use their eyes and ears (and sometimes their wits).

Things in exploration events are resolved by being observant, walking, finding a path, with the main enemy being the place itself.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters comes to a deep chasm. A rickety bridge leads across it. How will they cross the bridge? Will they go another way?
>- Millennia ago, wizards split the seas to allow people to pass between two islands, but it seems that this ancient magic is fading, and there are random currents of water from the sea walls. How will they cross this path to survive?
>- What seemed like a normal mountain is actually moving. It turns out to be the back of a giant turtle. The entire forest shakes and trembles as this huge beast moves. The characters must flee, but how and where?
>- The group of characters finds an old battlefield where a great battle once took place. What will they find there?
>- The group of characters passes through a field of magical plants that emit hallucinogenic drugs. The characters' nightmares become reality. What must they do to escape?

##### Mixed Events

Sometimes the storyteller may not be able to choose between the offered options and therefore can combine events.

Mixed events are events that blend several categories, either because they can change from one to another, or because they exhibit traits of both categories simultaneously.

>[!example]
>- (Combat and Story): The group of characters came to fight an evil witch who had killed many villagers. The witch says they can make a deal – if they let her go, she will give them an item that will greatly help them on their journey. If they fight, they will lose this item. This event starts as a story and can turn into a combat event, depending on how the parties negotiate.
>- (Exploration and Story): While exploring an abandoned mine, the group meets a small creature that seems lost. The creature is extremely cautious and scared of the group. But over time, they manage to befriend it. Once they are friends, the creature helps them pass through a dark cave. This event starts as exploration, continues as a story, and ends as exploration.
>- (Exploration and Combat): The group must find three items that bind ancient spirits to an abandoned mansion. They must destroy these items while the spirits attack and trouble them. This event is both exploration and combat.
>- (Exploration, Combat, and Story): The main villain has kidnapped an important character and plans to perform a ritual in their fortress. The characters can try to negotiate with the villain, attack directly, or infiltrate the fortress and quietly free their friend. The choice is theirs.

##### Rest Event

Rest events are when characters simply rest at a camp. During this rest, they can eat, heal their wounds, but they can also train their skills, weapon handling, or spells. In addition, they can engage in other activities, such as studying a mysterious book they have.

For longer journeys, it is recommended to give the characters at least one rest (one dice roll – for example, for regeneration or training, etc.)
