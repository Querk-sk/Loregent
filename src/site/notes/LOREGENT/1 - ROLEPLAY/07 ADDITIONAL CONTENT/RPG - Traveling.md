### Traveling

In every story, characters travel from one place to another. To make this traveling not boring, our RPG system does not use realistic traveling (where the exact distance characters travel is measured), but rather narrative traveling, where the distance is determined by the number of events or problems that the characters experience or need to solve.

#### Distance

Travel distance falls into three categories:

- Close    
- Farther    
- Very Far    

The storyteller does not need to think much about how many kilometers the characters need to travel. It is enough to decide between the three options (listed above). However, if the storyteller wants to determine the distance exactly, they can use the following list as a reference.

##### List of distances

1. Distance 0,5 Km || (15 minutes )
2. Distance 1 Km ||  (30 minutes)
3. Distance 5 Km ||  (1 hours)
4. Distance 10 Km ||  (2 hours)
5. Distance 50 Km || (10 hours)
6. Distance 100 Km || (20 hours)
7. Distance 500 Km || (4 days)
8. Distance 1 000 Km || (8 days)
9. Distance 5 000 Km || (1,5 months)
10. Distance 10 000 Km || (~3 months)
11. Distance 20 000 Km ||  (~6 months)

>[!note]
>- The time written for distances is the time it takes for a person to cover that distance. According to the internet, the walking speed of a person is approximately 5 km per hour.

#### Events

Distance only indicates how many events a character (or their entire group) experiences during travel. The number of events can be determined simply or more complexly. The group completes the entire distance once they experience (or solve) all the events that travel brings.

##### Simple Determination of Number of Events

- Close - 1 event    
- Farther - 2 events    
- Very Far - 3 events

##### Complex Determination of Number of Events

When the storyteller uses the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels#List of distances\|distance list]], the number of events the characters experience on the journey can be determined according to this list. The complexity level based on distance can then be used as a number to determine the complexity of all events during the journey. Alternatively, this number can be used to determine the number of event rolls according to the table of randomness. Everything is explained below.

###### Challenge level of Events

The challenge level (CL) based on distance determines the complexity of all events the characters encounter during the journey. This means that if the CL is 6, then the CL of one event will also be 6. However, the storyteller can divide this number into multiple events, for example, the characters experience 3 events, each with a CL of 2.

###### Number of Events

The CL based on distance determines the total number of events the characters encounter during the journey. This means that if the CL is 6, then the number of event rolls according to the tables of randomness will be 6. So the storyteller rolls the dice 6 times and chooses an event according to the tables. They can choose from the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter#Náhodné stretnutie\|random encounters]], a random task according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random conflict#Náhodný konflikt\|random conflicts]], or from the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Story cubes#Príbehové kocky\|story dice]]. They can also determine the weather according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Weather#Náhodné počasie\|random weather]] or the properties of the terrain according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random World#Náhodný svet\|random world]].

##### Note on Number of Events

The storyteller does not need to stick strictly to any numbers during journey planning. If they decide that nothing significant happened during the journey, that is fine. Or if they decide that instead of 6 smaller events, there will be one side quest - that is also fine. The storyteller has complete freedom in how many events to include in the journey and how significant they should be.

#### Types of Events

Each event falls into three categories:

- Combat Event    
- Story Event    
- Exploration Event    
- Mixed Events, which combine the previous ones    
- and Rest Event

##### Combat Event

Combat events may or may not be important for the story. Characters can fight against bandits, animals, or even living plants. It's a good opportunity for the storyteller to show what kinds of monsters exist in the world or what types of dangerous groups there are.

Things in combat events are resolved only through combat or some type of duel.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters has attracted the attention of the main villain, who sent some minions to test their strength.
>- The group of characters encounters someone they have taken money from.
>- The group of characters notices marks on the trees. However, they don't know that this territory belongs to monsters who attack the group because they ignored the warning (not noticing the marks).
>- The characters arrive in a village where the main lord is bored. So the lord organizes a race with obstacles (and monsters).

##### Story Event

In story events, roles are played as if in a theater play. Characters can encounter another character who talks to them and tells them something. Characters can get into negotiations with an enemy or attend a celebration.

Things in story events are mainly resolved through dialogue or by solving puzzles, problems, or mysteries.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters encounters a group of wandering musicians who travel the world and play wherever they are paid. They can exchange stories and important advice.
>- The group of characters comes across a golden carriage guarded by strong knights.
>- It seems that the group of characters has entered a territory where the ghosts of the deceased cannot, well, die, and they remain in this world. The same fate could befall the group unless they solve their problem.
>- The characters find a discreet shop where all items are obviously quite expensive and powerful. But when they ask for the price, the shopkeeper says they'll sell it for "a small favor."

##### Exploration Event

Exploration events reveal more about the place or the overall land where the characters are. They are not in any danger from enemies – the characters need to use their eyes and ears (and sometimes their wits).

Things in exploration events are resolved by being observant, walking, finding a path, with the main enemy being the place itself.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters comes to a deep chasm. A rickety bridge leads across it. How will they cross the bridge? Will they go another way?
>- Millennia ago, wizards split the seas to allow people to pass between two islands, but it seems that this ancient magic is fading, and there are random currents of water from the sea walls. How will they cross this path to survive?
>- What seemed like a normal mountain is actually moving. It turns out to be the back of a giant turtle. The entire forest shakes and trembles as this huge beast moves. The characters must flee, but how and where?
>- The group of characters finds an old battlefield where a great battle once took place. What will they find there?
>- The group of characters passes through a field of magical plants that emit hallucinogenic drugs. The characters' nightmares become reality. What must they do to escape?

##### Mixed Events

Sometimes the storyteller may not be able to choose between the offered options and therefore can combine events.

Mixed events are events that blend several categories, either because they can change from one to another, or because they exhibit traits of both categories simultaneously.

>[!example]
>- (Combat and Story): The group of characters came to fight an evil witch who had killed many villagers. The witch says they can make a deal – if they let her go, she will give them an item that will greatly help them on their journey. If they fight, they will lose this item. This event starts as a story and can turn into a combat event, depending on how the parties negotiate.
>- (Exploration and Story): While exploring an abandoned mine, the group meets a small creature that seems lost. The creature is extremely cautious and scared of the group. But over time, they manage to befriend it. Once they are friends, the creature helps them pass through a dark cave. This event starts as exploration, continues as a story, and ends as exploration.
>- (Exploration and Combat): The group must find three items that bind ancient spirits to an abandoned mansion. They must destroy these items while the spirits attack and trouble them. This event is both exploration and combat.
>- (Exploration, Combat, and Story): The main villain has kidnapped an important character and plans to perform a ritual in their fortress. The characters can try to negotiate with the villain, attack directly, or infiltrate the fortress and quietly free their friend. The choice is theirs.

##### Rest Event

Rest events are when characters simply rest at a camp. During this rest, they can eat, heal their wounds, but they can also train their skills, weapon handling, or spells. In addition, they can engage in other activities, such as studying a mysterious book they have.

For longer journeys, it is recommended to give the characters at least one rest (one dice roll – for example, for regeneration or training, etc.)
