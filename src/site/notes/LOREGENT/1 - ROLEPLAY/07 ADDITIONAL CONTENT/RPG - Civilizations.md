### Civilizations

The rules concerning civilizations are used when there are multiple factions in the game world. These factions can compete, form alliances, or wage wars. All rules and mechanics that apply to regular characters also apply to civilizations. Of course, there can be exceptions or changes in these rules, and therefore, we will remind you and describe how they differ.

#### Factions

In our RPG system, factions or civilizations include: states, groups, political parties, guilds (e.g., a thieves' guild), religious groups, trade chains, and so on. Factions always have someone who governs them – it can be a god, emperor, king, boss, or even a parliament.

When a character or city is a member of a faction, they gain (or lose) points in attributes, skills, and talents. Each faction has a certain number of points (a certain setup) that applies to them.

>[!info] 
>Specifically :
> -  Attributes: Each faction has two attributes. One attribute has a value of +1 and the other attribute has a value of -1.
> -  And the faction can choose from the following options:
> 	-  Either choose skills, where one skill can have +4 or two skills +2. While one other skill must have -4 or two skills -2
> 	-  Or choose talents, where one talent can have +4 or two talents +2. While one other talent must have -4 or two talents -2 (those that are important in the given world).
> 	-  Or choose spells, where one unique spell can have +4 or two unique spells +2. While one other spell must have -4 or two spells -2 (those that are important in the given world).
> 	- Or combine these options, where the faction can have, for example, one skill +2 and one talent +2. While one spell will have -2 and another skill -2.

#### City Attributes

>[!note]
> Although we write about a city, it also applies to entities like branches and such. So, places where more people work for a civilization or company.

Civilizations are made up of cities. Companies have branches, and organizations have departments. All these cities, branches, and departments are entities that work for their civilization (faction, company, etc.). The civilization, faction, or company itself does not do any work, it only gives orders.

The activities are carried out by the entities (i.e., cities, branches, departments, etc.). Therefore, these entities have their own attributes, just like any other character in our RPG system, following the same rules (though with some exceptions). This means that attributes change the number of dice when rolling for skills, change the number of dice in combat rolls, and also change the number of points the entity (i.e., city, branch, department, etc.) actually has. However, these attributes are adjusted according to the main attribute settings of the faction.

>[!example]
>When a player creates a character that will be part of a faction ruled by the god of war, their attributes at the start of character creation might be set like this:
>
>* plus 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] (strength) and minus 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] (intelligence)
>* plus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] axe fighting and plus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]
>* minus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]] and minus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]
>
> The player can invest points as they wish, but the character has this basic setup.

##### City Size

The size and level of a city are evaluated based on the number of points in its attributes.

> [!example] Example levels and sizes of cities:
>* Settlement - 1, 2, 3
>* Village - 4, 5, 6
>* Town - 7, 8, 9
>* Large City - 10, 11, 12
>* Metropolis - 13, 14, 15
>* and so on.

Whether a city is more of a settlement, village, or large city is mainly important for the story. As for the rules, the level (size) of the city limits the number of points it can improve. Let's imagine that a city has 1 point in all attributes - that is level 1 (in this case a Small Settlement). If the city is at level 1, it can improve a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] by a total of 1 point. No more. Conversely, if the city is at level 10, it can improve its skills, talents, or specializations by up to 10 points. This means the total number of points in skills, talents, and specializations will be 10.

>[!example]
> - A level 2 Village may not have any skill improved
> - A level 2 Village may have an improved skill such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] 1 (meaning it has improved by 1 point and can improve by 1 more point)
> - A level 2 Village may have improved skills such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] 1 and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] 1 (meaning it has improved by 2 points, which is the maximum)
> - A level 2 Village cannot have an improved skill such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] 2 and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] 1 (because that is 3 points, while the maximum is 2)

When a city can no longer improve its skills (or talents or specializations), it must improve one of its attributes (to increase its level and be able to improve something else again).

##### City Attributes

Cities can use all basic attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]). When a city receives 1 point in an attribute, it gets:

- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills STR\|strength skills]]        
    - +/- 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]        
    - +/- 1 in weight [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Inventory\|inventory]] ( [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] decreases the total inventory weight)        
- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills REF\|reflex skills]]        
    - +/- 1 in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed points]]        
- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills INT\|intelligence skills]]        
    - +/- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] points in each [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|training roll]]        
- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|social skills]]        
    - +/- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] points in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|wealth points]]        
- One point in any attribute:    
    - +/- 1 in combat roll and magic roll        
    - +/- 1 in health points

##### Points and the City

Mestá môžu používať body postavy a to nasledovne.:

Cities can use character points as follows:

- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has 4 health points.            
        - Plus 1 point for each point invested in all attributes.            
    - Health regeneration:        
        - Cities [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Healing injuries\|regenerate]] like characters. A city rolls a regeneration roll during its "turn."            
        - One city can repair another city.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has 4 speed points            
        - Plus 1 for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]            
    - Usage:        
        - Determines the order in combat or activity.            
        - Cities are constantly in combat in a sense, so combat rules are always followed, even if combat rolls are not made, but rather improvements (i.e., training skills or attributes).     
        - Used to purchase actions during a turn. 2 points allow a city to perform 1 slow action.    
        - (All city actions are slow actions).            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has 4 wealth points            
        - Plus 5 for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]            
    - Usage:        
        - These points are used when cities trade with each other.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - (Inventory consumes speed points)            
        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] reduces the total weight of the inventory by 1            
        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] adds 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed point ]]           
    - Usage:        
        - Items that increase skill points, talents, or specializations can be placed in the inventory. They may also increase basic attack, armor, or points (e.g., health, which is increased through specializations).            
        - Items that increase basic attributes do not exist.            
        - The weight of each item is determined by its price. A brief summary:            
            - If an item adds 1 die = weight 1                
                - (Die for skills and talents)                    
            - If an item adds 1 attack = weight 2                
            - If an item adds 1 armor = weight 3                
        - Armies are not counted in the inventory, as they are considered separate characters (like when a wizard summons a golem).            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]**    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has armor 1            
        - Plus 1 point for each point invested in STR            
    - Usage:        
        - Reduces the damage that the city receives.            
        - (If the city has negative armor, the attacking enemy reserves victories equal to the negative value).

#### Enhancement

A city gains additional attributes through enhancements. A city can improve its attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]), skills, talents, specializations, and combat statistics ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|armor]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|attack]]). Points ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health\|health]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Speed\|speed]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth\|wealth]]) can be improved either by enhancing the city's attributes or by enhancing specializations. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] can also be increased through trade.

Each skill and attribute is enhanced according to training rules. For example, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] can only be improved using the skill raw strength. However, an exception applies to cities: cities can enhance one skill using another skill if it can be logically justified. For example, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] can be improved using the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]] if research was conducted in the city to improve the muscle mass of the inhabitants. In such cases, the threshold required to gain 1 point in a skill or attribute is doubled, or the complexity level needed to gain points is doubled.

A city can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] to accelerate its [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|training]]. Each 1 point of wealth adds 1 training point.

#### Items

With the help of items, a city can improve its skills, talents, and specializations, even beyond their maximum level. Items cannot enhance [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] or city attributes. An item can be bought from another city or the black market (controlled by the storyteller) and placed in the inventory.

>[!example]
> - Field Hospital: talent healer (healing) +2
> - Cannon: attack +3
> - Mobile Generator: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] +1

A city can also "create" items according to the rules of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Items\|item creation]]. The only exception is that a city can use 1 wealth point to gain 1 point for creation (ordinary characters cannot).

Regarding the inventory, each item has its weight (as mentioned above). When the inventory is full (i.e., the city has run out of speed points), the city can no longer place any additional items in the inventory. If a city wants to get rid of its items, it must sell them to another city or destroy them without compensation (which costs 1 slow action). Materials that help in the creation of items (such as steel, oil, gas) are considered a special bundle. This means that one type of material can be placed in the inventory as a bundle that can hold 10 pieces of that material (if the city has several types of materials, they must be placed in separate bundles). Special materials add 1 point to the item creation.

#### City Actions

In a game with civilizations, all activities are considered combat or conflict. Therefore, the game is played according to combat rules. From previous chapters, we know that combat has three phases: declaration of action, execution of action, and result of action. Everything written in that chapter applies, but there are some exceptions.

During the declaration of action, a player selects one city or one army. The order in which cities or armies are selected is determined by the speed points of the civilization (or by rolling dice each round). The order in which city actions are declared is determined by the speed points of the city, not the entire civilization. In battles with armies, the order is determined by the attack value of the army. The fastest army is the one with the lowest attack.

Another exception is that each city can perform only one action per round (each action a city performs is considered a slow action).

Lastly, the result of the action (i.e., dice roll) can mean either damage, reduction of other points (e.g., skills), or creation of an item. It always depends on what is rolled. It doesn't always have to be damage. Cities cannot use the victory level rule for regular characters (cities can damage another city or army, but not disarm them).

##### List of Actions

In the game, an action is considered any activity that ends with a dice roll. This means that activities like negotiation, trading, and overall diplomacy (when cities talk to each other) are not considered actions.

Each city can perform only one action per round. A city can focus on enhancement (according to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|training rules]]), item creation, item destruction, attacking an enemy army, or repairing damage.

>[!note] 
> - If an army attacks a city and that city has already performed another action, it cannot defend against the army.
> - However, a city can defend itself if another city within the civilization has already performed an action.
> - If multiple armies attack a city, the rules for fighting multiple enemies apply (the city rolls its combat roll only once, and each army rolls its roll once. Then the city's roll result is compared to the rolls of all attacking armies).

Each army can perform two actions per round: one movement and one attack (or use of one spell). A round ends for an army whenever it attacks. If the army does not perform any movement, it reserves 1 victory in the attack.

##### Attack, Army, and Armor

The storyteller can decide whether cities will attack each other directly (one city rolls a combat roll and the other city rolls a combat roll). Or they can decide that cities will attack each other with the help of an army that must reach the enemy city to attack it (and may encounter another army on the way).

If the storyteller decides on the first scenario, the city's attack is calculated as _3 + points in all attributes + weapon_ (which the city has in its inventory) and _armor 1_. The player must determine what type of weapon and armor it is, or they can use the elemental system from the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Monsters from Pocket#Elementy\|magical monsters]].

In the second scenario, the city must create an army. The army is then considered a separate entity as if a wizard summoned a golem, and the creation of the army follows the same rules as when the city creates an item (and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item price rule\|price rule]] is the same). However, the army has several exceptions. Its attributes are Attack and Armor (and the type of attack and type of armor). The attack also represents health points (i.e., an army with an attack of 2 will have health 2. When damaged, the army's health and attack points decrease). Regarding speed points, an army with a lower attack is considered faster. Lastly, the army cannot hide in its own (or any other) city; it must be outside the city (where it can be repaired by the city, like an item).

##### Diplomacy or Trade

Cities can communicate with each other, express their wants or needs, or even engage in trade. Cities can trade in resources (where one city sells several points of steel to another), manufactured items (where one city sells a generator to another), or services (where one city helps another with repairs or directly with manufacturing or training). Trading itself does not count as an action (this mainly applies to trading resources and products). Trading only counts as an action when it involves services (where one city “produces” several training points for another).

Prices for goods and services are not fixed. It is recommended to use the item price rules, but each city can adjust the price according to its needs.

As for diplomacy, in addition to talking to each other, cities can force others to do something. This involves [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat#Social Combat\|RPG - Combat#Social Combat]] (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active conflict]]). Alternatively, civilizations can agree to create a large parliament where each civilization has one vote (or where they roll dice against each other for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|SOC]] skills).

#### Map

The storyteller does not have to use a drawn map with a specific number of squares (but if they want to, they can). They can use the distance rule during combat or the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Traveling\|traveling]] rule (where the complexity level derived from the distance converts into the number of rounds the army must overcome to reach its goal).

The terrain is the most important part of the map. Some squares may add dice to the army (or city) or may subtract dice. If the storyteller does not use a drawn map, they can use a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|luck dice]] or a table of randomness.

>[!example]
> 1. Lose 2 dice for all rolls
> 2. Lose 1 die for all rolls
> 3. No dice loss
> 4. No dice loss
> 5. Gain 1 die for all rolls
> 6. Gain 2 dice for all rolls
