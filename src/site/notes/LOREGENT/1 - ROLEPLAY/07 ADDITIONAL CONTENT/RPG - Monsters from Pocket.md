### Monsters from Pocket

Monsters from Pocket are, well, monsters that live in a world created by the narrator. These monsters have a purpose, forming part of the ecosystem and food chain. Besides solving human problems (like on a farm), they also engage in battles, as they possess magical abilities and can cast various spells.

In our RPG system, magical monsters (referred to as monsters) are considered "unimportant characters." Their dice rolls work similarly to other characters, as do their points, but their attributes and skills differ slightly.

#### Unimportant Character

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Character\|Unimportant Character]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Enemy\|Unimportant Enemy]]

What it is = A character stronger than extras. This character doesn’t have a name, just a single title and function.

For example = guards on the castle walls, snow demons, or like the special zombies (Spitter) in Left 4 Dead.

Permissions = One attribute (maximum two) is assigned in which points can be placed (e.g., only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]). Additionally, a talent or specialization is determined, and the character receives the same number of points in it as in the main [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]]. The number of points a character can get is determined by their level or by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

b. Attributes = Determined by level. Points can be placed in one or a maximum of two Attributes (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2 or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 1). If an odd number of points, the first attribute gets more points. There can also be characters with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attributes.

b. Skills = The character has one [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] - but no points in skills. The number of points in talent and specialization is determined by level.

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

#### Attributes, Level, Evolution

Each monster, like any other character, has basic attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]). These attributes receive points based on the monster's level and evolution. The level indicates how many points the monster can distribute among its attributes (1 point per level). Evolution determines how many attributes the monster can allocate points to.

>[!example]
>
>Monster Level 3, Evolution A: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 3
>Monster Level 5, Evolution B: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 2
>Monster Level 8, Evolution C: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] 2

Each monster (and its evolution) has predetermined attributes to allocate points to. It doesn't have to start with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], it could be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] or another attribute. Monsters can have various attribute combinations, such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]. The narrator determines the monster's attributes when creating them for the game.

Each monster is assigned a primary attribute. This attribute receives the most points, especially when the number of points is odd. The remaining attributes receive points according to their order.

However, the trainer character can ignore this rule. When the monster levels up, they can invest a point in any attribute.

##### Level and Evolution

Each monster in our RPG system has three evolutions representing stages of maturity. The first evolution is a juvenile, the second is akin to an adolescent, and the third is adulthood. Each evolution has a set maximum level. When a monster surpasses this level, it evolves to the next stage.

>[!example]
>* Evolution A: Minimum level 1, maximum 4
>* Evolution B: Minimum level 5, maximum 8
>* Evolution C: Minimum level 9, maximum 99

###### Experience

Monsters gain experience by defeating enemies or through training (see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Training\|chapter on training]], attribute training rule). After accumulating 1000 points, a monster advances by 1 level. Each time a level is gained, the monster receives 1 point to invest in one of its attributes.

For each enemy defeated, a monster earns:

- 10 training points (as a base)    
- Plus points for the difference between the monster's level and its enemy's level:   
- Enemy's level minus monster's level, times 10
- If the difference is negative, then 0

##### Monsters and Attributes

Monsters can utilize all basic attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]). However, the number of attributes into which they can allocate points is determined by their evolution.

- Evolution A - only one attribute    
- Evolution B - only two attributes    
- Evolution C - only three attributes

The narrator decides which attributes the monster can use (when creating monsters for their world). Some monsters may have various combinations of attributes, such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]].

When a monster gains 1 point in an attribute, it gains:

- **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] adds or subtracts:**    
    - +/- 1 die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills STR\|strength skills]]        
    - +/- 1 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Health Points]]

    - +/- 1 die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills REF\|reflex skills]]        
    - +/- 1 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Speed Points]]        
- **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] adds or subtracts:**    
    - +/- 1 die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills INT\|intelligence skills]]        
    - !! +/- 1 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]        
- **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] adds or subtracts:**    
    - +/- 1 die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|social skills]]        
    - +/- 1 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Wealth Points]]

##### Points and Monsters

Monsters can use character points as follows:

- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each monster has 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]].            
        - Plus 1 point for each level            
        - Plus 1 point for each point invested in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] attribute.            
    - Health regeneration:        
        - Monsters can [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Liečenie zranenia\|regenerate]] using their spell, recovering full [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] (not fractions).        
        - Trainers can regenerate the monster directly in battle or out of battle using a magical item (the monster will receive full health points).          
        - Monsters can fully heal at a healing center (in a city). The cost for healing 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/HP\|HP]] is 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] from the trainer.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each monster has 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].            
        - Plus 1 for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].            
    - Usage:        
        - Determines the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat#Kolá v boji\|order of actions in combat]].            
        - These points are used for purchasing spells.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]** (aka Special):    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each monster has 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]].            
        - Plus 1 for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].            
    - Usage:        
        - These points are used for purchasing spells.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]]**:    
    - Number of points:

        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] cannot be increased by attributes, levels, or items.            
    - Usage:        
        - Trainers can place one or more items in the monster's inventory. Items add points to attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]).            
        - The weight of each item is determined by how many points it adds to attributes. An item with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] +1 will weigh 1, and so on.            
        - The inventory can also include items that increase basic attack or armor. Their weight will also be 1 per point.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]**    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each monster has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] 0.            
        - Plus 1 point for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]].            
        - Armor doesn't gain points from level or evolution.            
    - Usage:        
        - Protects health points. Armor points are depleted before health points.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]**:    
    - Monsters can sacrifice [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - Speed points can be exchanged for additional actions in battle but only once per round.        
    - For 1 speed point, they get 1 quick action; for 2 points, they get 1 slow action.        
    - Note: All monster attacks are slow actions, while all trainer actions are quick actions.

##### Monsters, Talent, and Skills

Monsters cannot allocate points to talents, specializations, or skills. They can roll for skills normally, with a roll of 3 + the Attribute of the skill.

#### Types of Monsters

Monsters are categorized by their attack type (melee or ranged), their element (e.g., fire or water), and the animal they resemble (e.g., snake or bear).

The most significant impact on gameplay is the attack type and element, which determine how the monster will attack, what spells it will have, and which element it will be disadvantaged against. The type of monster (e.g., ground or flying) is more important for appearance and story, though some types may have additional attacks (e.g., birds may have aerial attacks).

##### Monsters by Movement Type

Each monster moves in a specific way. This has more of a narrative impact than a combat one.

- Ground Type: Monster moves on the ground    
    - Two Legs: Like a monkey or an animal with four legs that walks on two.        
    - Four Legs: Like a cat or dog, etc.        
    - Crawling/Swimming/Flowing: A monster that resembles a snake, or one that can swim in water but crawls on land, or a liquid or jelly that flows.        
    - Levitating/No Legs/Hopping: A monster that levitates a few centimeters above the ground. It's as if it has legs, but doesn't. It may also move by hopping.        
- Flying Type: Monster flies in the air like a bird, or levitates in the air like a bird.    

If the narrator wants the movement type to affect gameplay, they can decide that ground types get +2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] and flying types get +2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] (regardless of the monster's level or evolution).

##### Monsters by Attack Type

Each monster has its weapons (hands, claws, tail, etc.) with which it attacks. These basic weapons follow the same rules as all weapons in LW RPG. The same applies to their spells.

###### Weapon and Armor Types

In battles with monsters, elements and attack types like "sharp weapons, blunt weapons," etc., determine whether the monster fights with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|advantage]] / [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]], and how much damage they take.

###### Weapons and Distance

In battles with monsters, spells and weapons follow the same rules as any other weapons in LW RPG. A slight exception is the rule for the complexity of hitting with a ranged weapon. Monster spells do not have a basic complexity level (e.g., medium firearms have a CL of 2), but each ranged spell uses the complexity table based on distance, target's movement speed, and cover (see table).

###### Distances

In battles with monsters, all distances are used except for “Even further” and “Far away.”

#### Elements

Each monster can have only one element.

Elements affect the monster's appearance (e.g., the monster is burning) and attack (even the basic one). This is important because each monster is sensitive to one element and resistant to another. In this document, we will use elements created within LW RPG; however, the narrator can create their own system. In LW RPG, we use primary elements, expanded elements, composite elements, and pseudo-elements. To make this clear, we have created the following list, where we have selected some elements, categorizing each under the main element, according to which sensitivity is determined.

***Fire**
- Fire    
- Lava    
- Plasma    
- Electricity    
- Hot chocolate    
- Anything with higher temperature or functioning like electricity    

**Water**
- Water    
- Snow    
- Ice    
- Ice cream    
- Jelly candies    
- Mud    
- Plants / fungi    
- All liquids or semi-liquids (milk, blood, wine, porridge, etc.)    

**Earth**
- Earth    
- Rock    
- Metal    
- Beetle (poison, acid)    
- Trash / rot    
- Solid candies (caramel)    
- All minerals and solid things (diamond, gold, etc.)    

**Wind**
- Wind    
- Tornado    
- Ghost    
- Sound, vibrations, frequency (known as element Darkness in LW)    
- Marshmallow    
- Anything airy and ethereal    

**Physics (Physical Force)**
- Life (organics / flesh)    
- Chance    
- Time    
- Gravity (magnetism)    
- Radiation (known as element Light in LW)    
- Telekinesis    
- Anything that is a physical force or psychic force

###### Relationship Between Elements

In combat, each monster with an element can be either weak or resistant to another element. This weakness or resistance affects the attack outcome.

When a monster attacks an enemy whose element is **weak** against the attacker's element:

- The monster rolls with advantage (i.e., a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 counts as a win for that die).    
- The enemy rolls with disadvantage (i.e., only a roll of 5 or 6 counts as a win for that die).    

When a monster attacks an enemy whose element is **strong** against the attacker's element:

- The monster rolls with disadvantage (i.e., only a roll of 5 or 6 counts as a win for that die).    
- The enemy rolls with advantage (i.e., a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 counts as a win for that die).    

When a monster attacks an enemy whose element is **the same** as the attacker's element, the dice are rolled normally (without advantage or disadvantage).

>[!example]
>
>* The attacker has the Water element, and the enemy has the Fire element.
>* The attacker rolls with advantage (i.e., a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 counts as a win for that die).
>* The enemy rolls with disadvantage (i.e., only a roll of 5 or 6 counts as a win for that die).

##### Armor Type

Similar to characters, monsters also follow the rule regarding weapon and armor types. Each monster can have only one type of weapon and one type of armor, and these types can be different—they don't have to be the same.

>[!example]
>Floraculla - weapon: fangs = piercing melee weapon, armor = resistant to blunt

Armor effectiveness against damage indicates how well the armor mitigates enemy damage. Armors are categorized by their effectiveness against weapons as follows:

(For reference)

### Armor

Armor is a passive protection that shields a character from damage in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]] or during a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|quick solution to the situation]]. The number of armor points is determined by the narrator. Unless otherwise specified, every character receives **0 armor points**.

Armor can be increased with items like helmets, gloves, or bulletproof vests. Armor can also be permanently increased by a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk\|natural trait]] the character is born with (e.g., a turtle's shell).

There is no maximum armor level, but it can only be reduced to zero. Armor does not go into negative numbers.

#### How Armor Works

Unless otherwise specified, armor is a passive protection that shields [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] by reducing the damage a character would receive from an attacker.

>[!example]
>- The enemy rolls 6 victories in their combat roll
>- The character rolls 2 victories in their combat roll.
> <br>
>- The character's health points should decrease by 4 points.
>- However, the character has 3 armor points.
>- Therefore, their health points decrease by only 1.

Although armor reduces damage, it does not reduce the victory level. So if a character wins the combat roll but does not cause any injury to the enemy, they can use other options listed in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|chapter on victory levels]].

#### Armor Strength

Each piece of protective gear adds armor points directly. All armor points (even from multiple items) are then totaled together. So if a character is wearing, for example, a helmet +1, body armor +3, and boots +2, their armor score would be 6. Armor is calculated separately only when an enemy or character decides to attack a specific part of the body (e.g., attacking the hands).

The armor level of a given item is not judged by the period or genre in which the story takes place. Whether it's medieval, sci-fi, or magical - an armor level of 1 represents weak or small armor, and a level of 5 represents large or high-quality armor.

1. Weak or small armor    
2. Below-average armor or medium armor    
3. Average armor or standard size    
4. Above-average armor or larger    
5. High-quality armor or largest

#### Armor Specialization

All information on specialization can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization#Specialization and Armor\|relevant chapter]]. But in short: the number of points a character invests in specialization for a certain type of armor (e.g., samurai armor) increases their armor points for that specific armor when equipped.

Armor specialization must be tied to a job, type of martial arts, or specific magic. A character cannot have a general light armor specialization for all kinds of light armor but must specify the type, such as light samurai armor.

#### Types of Armor

However, the rating of armor does not end with a number. Each armor must also have its type specified, which indicates which type of weapon the armor is resistant to and which it is weak against. In our RPG system, we divide armor by resistance (against weapons) into three types:

- **Light Armor**: resistant to one type of weapon. It has a weight of 1, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to multiple skills.    
- **Medium Armor**: resistant to two types of weapons. Its weight is 2, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to one skill.    
- **Heavy Armor**: resistant to three types of weapons. Its weight is 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it cannot add points to skills.    

This resistance can manifest in the game in various ways. Either the light armor gets damaged after each successful enemy attack, or the light armor won't protect the character as well. The narrator can decide which method to use, create their own method, or combine multiple methods.

##### Armor Damage

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain type of weapon. After each successful enemy attack, the armor is slightly damaged, reducing the armor points by 1. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the weak armor takes full damage.    
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain type of weapon. Therefore, it does not get damaged during a successful enemy attack. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the resistant armor takes only half damage.    
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)    

Damaged armor can be repaired by a blacksmith, or if the character has the appropriate talent and tools, they can repair the armor themselves.

##### Armor Effectiveness

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 2 armor points block only 1 damage point.    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is weak against the given weapon). The enemy receives 3 damage points.        
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 1 armor point blocks 2 damage points (i.e., the number of damage points is halved, rounded down).    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is resistant to the given weapon). The enemy receives 0 damage points.        
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)

##### In Our Universe

In our story universe, armor is divided according to the type of weapon attack it faces (see the list):

###### Against Blunt Weapons and Explosives
- This armor is resistant to blunt weapons and explosives. This means that blunt weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Blunt Weapons\|Blunt Weapons]] are: hammers, maces, clubs, and similar. Also includes blunt throwing weapons.)    
- (Explosives fall under [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Explosive Weapons\|Explosive Weapons]]. These include: grenades, explosive arrows, explosive spells, and similar.)

###### Against Sharp Weapons
- This armor is resistant to sharp weapons. This means that sharp weapons do not harm this armor. 
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Sharp Weapons\|Sharp Weapons]] are: axes, swords, katanas, knives, shurikens, and similar. Also includes sharp throwing weapons.)

###### Against Piercing Weapons
- This armor is resistant to piercing weapons. This means that piercing weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- Applies to ranged and stabbing weapons.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Piercing Weapons\|Ranged Weapons]] are: arrows, bullets—everything shot from a weapon (not throwing weapons).    
- (Stabbing weapons: rapiers, spears, and other weapons designed for stabbing.)

###### Mixed Armor
- A character's armor is "mixed" when they wear pieces of various types of armor on their body.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

 ###### Without Armor
- A character is "without armor" when they have no items or clothing on their body that could be considered armor. Or when it is natural armor, like a turtle's shell.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

#### Armor and Elements

In our universe, the rule is that every armor is weak against all elements unless it has magical resistance against a particular element.

Regarding elements in general, our story universe follows the rule that all elements are equal. This means that no element is inherently weak against another element.

However, if the narrator wants certain elements to be stronger or weaker against each other (similar to the game Pokémon), they can follow the chapter on "[[RPG - Pocket Monsters#Elements\|Pocket Monsters]]."

#### Energy Armor

This is protection that uses energy (magic or photons) instead of solid materials (such as iron). Energy armor functions similarly to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]. When a character takes damage, their energy armor points are depleted before their health points. Once the energy armor is depleted, the character is no longer protected.

Such armor can also be recharged. The method depends on the story (sometimes a specific item or battery is needed, or if it's magic, the shield is charged from the character's energy through a spell). The narrator sets the limitations of energy armor and its recharging options. The narrator may decide that the armor can be recharged automatically after combat or, in certain cases (using a spell or item), even during combat.

Energy armor does not affect the character's weight. Some weapons may be more effective against it (meaning some weapons deplete 2 or 3 points instead of 1). Some elements may completely ignore it (e.g., a poisonous cloud that depletes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] directly).

In close combat, energy armor functions normally.

#### Magical Armor Abilities

Magical properties of armor are special abilities that provide additional protection or advantage to a character. To activate these properties, the character must meet certain conditions. Some magical properties are activated by spells, or a combination of talent, skill, or specialization. Other magical properties are activated when certain numbers or ranges of numbers are rolled on the dice.

> [!example]
> * **Thorn Armor** - When a 1 is rolled on the dice, the enemy receives as much damage as the number of dice with a 1.
> * **Ice Armor** - Reduces the speed of nearby characters by 1 point (speed) for as many rounds as the character rolled victories.
> * **Spider Armor** - The character can use the "pull" spell. It combines Dexterity + specialization in Spider Armor. The character chooses a target, and the narrator determines the difficulty level.

These magical properties can only be activated when the character has a specialization for a specific type of armor. So if the character has a specialization in heavy armor and is wearing heavy armor with magical properties, they can use the magical properties. If they had a different armor, they could not. The number of points invested in specialization adds dice to the roll or shifts the activation threshold.

- Specialization 1, 2 = when a 1 is rolled    
- Specialization 3, 4 = when a 1, 2 is rolled    
- Specialization 5, 6 = when a 1, 2, 3 is rolled (3 is the maximum)

> [!example]
> For protective properties, numbers 1, 2, 3 are used. For supportive or offensive properties, numbers 4, 5, 6 are used.

As for the cost, magical properties are considered armor points. So if heavy armor has 3 armor points and magical properties add 2 points, the cost will be the same as if the heavy armor had 5 armor points.

In terms of weight, magical properties do not count towards the weight. However, the narrator can change this and, for example, increase the armor's weight.

#### Combat, Attack, and Spells

In our RPG system, battles with monsters follow the same rules as battles with any other characters, with a few modifications.

At the start of the battle, each trainer selects one monster to fight. In each round, the trainer whose monster has the least speed points announces what their monster will do. The trainer whose monster has the most speed points then announces what their monster will do, and can react to the "slower" trainer's decision (which cannot be changed).

Dice are rolled, and the monster with the most successes wins the round. The number of successes the monster rolled is subtracted from the enemy's successes, and the remainder becomes the victory level. Based on this level, the monster deals damage to the enemy.

A monster that loses all health points is out of the battle. The winner (both the monster and its trainer) gains experience equal to the victory amount. The defeated trainer can choose another monster to continue fighting. The winner can also change their monster or choose not to (if they decide not to change, they can use 1 item without affecting the number of actions their monster has in that round).

A trainer with no remaining monsters is out of the battle completely. They are also out if they decide to flee.

>[!info]
>Alternatively, two monsters and the trainer can join the battle to fight side by side.

#### Combat Actions

In each round, a monster can perform one slow action (or two quick actions). If a trainer decides to engage in combat (e.g., using a healing potion), the monster loses one quick action (since each trainer action is a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers#List of Maneuvers\|quick action]]).

Activities involving the use of consumable items (e.g., healing potions or armor-boosting potions) or blessings from the trainer (which have the same effect as potions) can be performed by the trainer before the monster and enemy attacks.

Activities involving switching monsters or purchasing an additional action in combat (where the first attack is considered a supporting roll for the second attack) can only be performed by the trainer after the monster and enemy attacks.

##### Maximum Damage

The rule on maximum damage to the enemy does not apply to monsters.

#### Spell Attributes

Spells in combat are used to damage enemies, defend the monster, restore its points, or gain some advantage. These spells are abilities that the monster knows inherently and do not need to be learned. The only limitations on the number of spells a monster can use are its Evolution and Element. Spells have no weight and do not need to be "equipped" in order to be used (unlike a sword).

In addition to these primary attributes (Evolution and Element), spells also have other attributes, such as weapon type, action type, formula for calculating the number of dice the monster can roll, and the result.

##### Spell Evolution

Evolution limits the spells a monster can use. A monster in Evolution A cannot use spells from Evolution B or C. Conversely, a monster in Evolution C can use spells from Evolution A and B. Evolution also affects the attack calculation and the spell cost.

##### Spell Cost

A monster must sacrifice a few points to use a spell.

- Basic Attack = 0 points    
- Spell Evolution A = 1 point    
- Spell Evolution B = 2 points    
- Spell Evolution C = 3 points

A monster can use wealth points, speed points, and health points to purchase spells. The cost for each spell is fixed and does not change due to points. If a monster lacks sufficient points, it can use the Basic Attack, which replenishes points. (Details on the Basic Attack can be found in the spell list).

##### Spell Element

Each spell must specify the element it is intended for (e.g., water) and may also specify a sub-element (e.g., freezing). If a spell is intended for a specific sub-element, a monster of the main element or a different sub-element cannot use that spell at all.

Exceptions are spells (attacks) that can be used by monsters of all elements. These include the Basic Attack.

##### Weapon Type

In most cases, the weapon type of a spell matches the weapon type of the monster. So if a monster has a blunt melee weapon, its spells will also be blunt melee weapons. Some spells may change this type, but this is rare.

##### Action Type

In the vast majority of cases, each spell and maneuver is a slow action.

>[!note]
>Monsters can use all appropriate maneuvers from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|chapter on maneuvers]]. However, they will always be slow actions.

##### Number of Dice

Each spell must specify how to calculate the number of dice the monster can roll.

This number is calculated from the basic attack, which is 3 + "number of dice from the item in the monster's inventory that adds to the attack."

Higher evolution spells can use multiple attributes in their roll.
- Evolution A Spell can use only one attribute, e.g., just STR    
- Evolution B Spell can use two attributes, e.g., just REF and SOC    
- Evolution C Spell can use three attributes, e.g., just STR, REF, and INT    

Higher evolution spells can use an attribute multiple times.

>[!example]
>
>Evolution A Spell ... + 1 x STR
>Evolution B Spell ... + 2 x STR
>Evolution C Spell ... + 3 x STR

###### Choosing Attributes for Spells

Attributes for spells are chosen based on what activity or skill they resemble, or by which point they influence.

For higher evolutions, the choice of attribute depends more on the narrator's intuition, and whether the spell uses only one skill or includes a second or third skill (e.g., whether brute strength also uses agility). Alternatively, the spell may continue to strengthen only one skill.

##### Spell Outcome

A monster can affect either itself, the enemy, or both with its spell.

Each spell can only affect one type of point or combat attribute. Regarding points, a spell can affect Health Points, Speed Points, and Armor. Concerning combat attributes, a spell can affect attack strength, the number of actions per round (each monster can take one slow action, which a spell can reduce or increase), and the number of spells a monster can use (e.g., blocking Evolution C spells even if the monster is of the highest evolution).

Spells can also have passive effects. These activate when a die shows a 1 (for defensive spells) or a 6 (for offensive spells). The strength of the effect depends on the evolution.

- Evolution A Spell can have a very weak passive effect (1 point) that lasts 1 round  
- Evolution B Spell can have a weak passive effect (1 point) activated by a die number, lasting 1 round.    
- Evolution C Spell can have a strong passive effect (1-3 points) activated by a die number, lasting 1 round, or weaker effects (1 point) lasting until the end of the round.    

Spells do not have a status effect (like poison, where a monster loses 1 HP per round). Each spell has an effect that lasts until the next round or until the end of the battle (e.g., poison limits the monster's health points by 1, meaning that point cannot be healed by any spell).

#### Spell Examples

##### For All Elements and Monsters

These spells can be used by monsters of all elements. The monster's element transfers to the attack, meaning if the monster is, for example, fire-elemental, its basic attack will also be fire-elemental. If the monster is water-elemental, its basic attack will also be water-elemental.

###### Basic Attack (All Monsters)

Evolution All (cost 0)    
Element According to the monster's element   
Weapon Type According to the monster's weapon    
Action Slow Action

Dice Roll: 3 dice + item from the monster's inventory that adds to the attack 
Result: Damage to the enemy + restoration of speed points + attack repetition

Description:

The monster attacks the enemy, dealing damage. The monster restores 1 speed point + 1 point for each damage dealt to the enemy (so at least 1).

If a 6 is rolled, the monster can roll again (the number of successes is added to the previous roll's successes).

If two 6s are rolled in the repeated roll, the monster can go again (the number of successes is added to the previous roll).

If three 6s are rolled in the next repeated roll, the monster can roll once more (the number of successes is added to the previous rolls).

And so on.

If the trainer does not have talent in controlling the monster, the basic attack does not lose any dice. However, the monster cannot roll multiple times in succession, even if a 6 is rolled.

The basic attack is also used to calculate the dice roll for all other spells. The rule for restoring speed points applies only to the basic attack.

#### Trainer, Talent, and Specialization

A trainer is a character who owns a monster. They are responsible for training it (according to training rules) and other care (such as healing outside of combat). During combat, the trainer gives commands to their monster, such as which attack to use or when to hide. Additionally, the trainer can add items to the monster's inventory, enhancing its attributes or points. These items can only be added or swapped outside of combat.

Regarding talents and occupations, a trainer must have a talent to utilize their monster effectively. As long as the talent is connected to the monster's primary element (e.g., fire), it automatically applies to sub-elements as well. Occupations are more voluntary and provide the trainer with ways to approach their monster (e.g., a scientist can better identify them, or a doctor can heal them). Occupations are listed separately and are not related to the monster's element.

Specialization works a bit differently. It acts as an inventory where monsters are stored (similar to Poké Balls on a belt). So whenever a trainer captures a monster, they record it in the character table under specializations. Without this, they cannot control the monster.

##### Talent

A trainer needs a talent connected to the primary element of the monster (which automatically applies to sub-elements as well). Without this talent, the monster receives no additional dice from specialization in combat, or (if the narrator decides) the monster loses 2 dice from each roll. Talents apply not only in combat (e.g., when the trainer wants to use a healing item) but also outside it (e.g., when the trainer wants their monster to knock down a tree) or even on other monsters (e.g., when hiding from a wild monster in the forest).

In some activities, talents can be combined. For example, a talent for fire monsters and a talent as a monster healer can be combined when the trainer wants to heal a fire monster.

##### Specialization

In a standard game, specializations are used to enhance the monster, as the number of points the trainer invests in specialization (for a particular monster) increases the number of dice the monster gets in combat. The narrator can decide whether this specialization applies to a specific monster (like Lakti) or to an element or sub-element.

In the LW world, if a trainer wants to own a monster and send it into combat, they must invest 1 point in specialization (it is mandatory). This specialization acts as an inventory where the trainer stores monsters. Whenever the trainer captures a monster, they must deduct 1 point from another skill to invest in the specialization and thus gain the monster.

However, this specialization applies only to that one monster. For example, if a trainer has 10 monsters, they must create a separate specialization for each one (e.g., "Firruzli 1b"). The trainer can also invest additional points in specializations when they level up (gain 1000 experience points), without restriction on where the points are allocated (even if currently fighting with Firruzli and leveling up, they can allocate the point elsewhere, e.g., to Lakti). However, a trainer can invest a maximum of 4 points in one monster.

Specialization adds an extra die for the specified monster in combat.

If the trainer permanently loses a monster, they regain only one point from the specialization (the remaining points are lost).

##### Experience

The trainer gains the same amount of experience as the monster. This experience is equally divided between the trainer and the monster. However, the trainer must reach 1000 points to add another point to the talent or to the monster's specialization.

#### Catching Monsters

The narrator can determine how monsters are captured and under what conditions. However, it's always true that only wild monsters can be caught, not those belonging to another trainer.

In the LW world, there are no balls or other containers. Trainers catch monsters by defeating them (bringing their health points to 0) and then touching them while saying a capture spell. To summon the monster from their soul again, they must say the monster's name and a summoning spell. When the monster is in the soul, time stops for it, as if it ceases to exist until summoned again. This means that to fully heal or change the monster's inventory, the trainer must summon it. Additionally, if the monster is poisoned, its health points do not deplete.

Even when the monster is in the soul, its health, speed points, and wealth slowly regenerate at a rate of 1 point every 24 hours (points regenerate simultaneously, so 1 point for health, speed, and wealth each).

The trainer does not receive any negative statuses from the monster (such as poison or disease). The monster's status is cured after 24 hours in the soul.

If the trainer dies, their monsters disappear.

#### Random Encounters

Random encounters occur in the wild or other abandoned places where wild monsters live. The narrator determines locations where monsters might be found (and their types). When a trainer passes through these locations, they roll for luck.

1. Monster with a level higher by 6
2. Monster with a level higher by 4
3. Monster with a level higher by 2
4. No monster, or a monster with a level lower by 2
5. No monster, or a monster with a level lower by 4
6. No monster, or a monster the trainer wants to catch, or something rare
