### Random World Rules

Every world operates in a certain way, and if the storyteller needs one or two rules for their world, they can choose from the following tables using the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Dice of Chance\|chance die]]. They must roll three dice, with the first die determining the group, the second determining the column, and the third determining the item.

**When the first die rolls: 1 or 2**

#### Group No. 1 (When the Die Rolls 1 or 2)

##### Column - 1 - 

###### Item 1 - Underworld

In this world, there is an underworld where beings go when they die. The way a being dies is reflected in its appearance – for example, it may wander around with a severed head. Beings can escape from this underworld or find employment there or do other work. If a being leaves the underworld without being employed (meaning it didn't find a job there), it is stuck in the place where it died, for example, it cannot leave a house – it simply cannot. However, it can return to the underworld. The being is always a ghost – an ugly creature that controls unique magic based on its state and can decide whether to help or harm others.

###### Item 2 - Diary

In this world, there exists a diary. When someone writes a name, manner, and time into it – the being will die exactly as written. This diary is managed by the spirit of death, who is bored and thus created the diary. The spirit enjoys playing with people and the diary owners.

Another variant of the diary could be a diary of fate, where the being can change the fate of others (for example, turn someone's victory into a loss). Or it could be a diary of sins, where the being sees all the sins of all beings (especially the one it is looking at). Or this diary could be a list of demons – where the being finds a demon of interest and the demon fulfills its wish, of course, for a price.

###### Item 3 - Dreams

In this world, there exists technology that allows one to enter another being's dream. This technology is used either as a therapeutic tool for a psychologist or as a tool for stealing ideas. When someone enters the dream world, they are at the mercy of the logic of the dream, which is determined by the dreamer (for example, gravity might work strangely there, they might breathe underwater, or the dream might completely change the characters – turning them into fireflies). The one who entered the dream must avoid changing and must maintain their own shape at all times. They must, of course, not die. They can wake up on their own, at any time (and even if the dreamer wakes up, no one dies).

###### Item 4 - 10-year-old from Home

Craftsmen, wizards, scientists, or a certain type of beings have a rule in this world. When they reach the age of 10, they must leave their home for 20 years. During their journey around the world, they must improve in their craft (and of course, they must survive, find work, etc.).

###### Item 5 - Aliens

In this world, there are aliens who crashed there by sheer accident. These aliens were taken by the government for study to learn as much as possible about them and use their technology. More aliens may come, or they may not. The discovery of the aliens can be kept secret, or it may not.

###### Item 6 - Music and Emotions

In this world, magic (or technology) is powered by music and emotions. That is the main magical force (or electricity). Alternatively, the whole world functions on some kind of music (and emotions changes effect of the music ).

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 1 - Sunken

A catastrophe occurred and in this world, most of the land is permanently submerged (or affected by another element). The beings have already adapted to the new life and continue as best as they can (basically rebuilding the same society - of course with limitations). Now treasure hunters venture into the ruins of the old world to dig out treasures from the past era (or take whatever they find useful).

###### Item 2 - Strange Laws

The world has strange laws, whether they be physical, chemical, or other natural laws. For example, a person might be able to walk on the ceiling. From white walls, bird chirping might be heard (the wall is, of course, solid). The environment might contain small cubes that can be manipulated (e.g., collected and stacked using some tool to create a uniform surface). The laws of this world have their own logic, but compared to our world, they are completely strange.

###### Item 3 - Castle

In the clouds of this world, there is a flying castle (or some fortress), which is abandoned and no one has ever been there. It might be a remnant of an old civilization, or a new civilization might have arrived. This castle hides a power that can change the whole world. Whether for better or worse, depends on who finds the castle.

###### Item 4 - Angels and Demons

In this world, there exist religious beings - angels and demons, who fight against each other. The beings of this world use them for their own purposes.

###### Item 5 - Monsters

Monsters (such as vampires) live in this world, and they have their own way of life. These monsters may have built a society. How they influence the beings of this world depends on the author. But monsters always have to affect the inhabitants in some way.

###### Item 6 - Sport

In this world, there is one sport that is incredibly popular, to the point that the entire world revolves around it - parliament passes laws for this sport, beings learn it in schools and universities, and even industries create things for this sport (e.g., unreal tournament).

##### Column - 3 -

###### Item 1 - PC World

Beings can transfer themselves into a computer world with the help of a machine that digitizes them. In the computer world, the same rules apply to them as to programs.

###### Item 2 - Mega City

In this world, there is one large and mega-dense city that looks like a cube from the outside, but inside it's a mish-mash of roads, buildings, and other things a city needs. And the city has both old buildings (ancient shrines) and new buildings.

###### Item 3 - Exists

In this world, there are stories that are read to children or series that are broadcast on TV. But one story that is broadcast, even though it is fiction, actually exists; it's just that no one knows.

###### Item 4 - Gods

In this world, gods exist. These gods interfere with the lives of beings according to what the gods represent. For example, the goddess of love manipulates love, creating love triangles. The gods in this world can communicate directly with the beings they choose and can grant these beings unique magic (other beings don't have this magic, only blessed beings do).

###### Item 5 - From Dimension

The world was invaded by beings from another dimension who can jump between dimensions and stop time. So the beings from the invaded dimension started to defend themselves and at the same time began to look for an artifact that would stop the invaders. However, the artifact is located in other dimensions, so these defending beings decided to jump to other dimensions of the multiverse.

These beings (who are defending) exist only thanks to quantum computers that remember their existence. And if these computers don't remember something, it ceases to exist. Therefore, during a jump, they might lose an arm.

These beings must be connected to their world (or base) with a cable (the cable travels with them and looks more like an antenna). If they lose the cable, they will be forever trapped in the other dimension or disappear. 

###### Item 6 - Fungus

A catastrophe occurred in the world that caused a toxic fungus to spread across the world, killing everything it touches and transforming all nature and animals beyond recognition. This fungus creates a toxic jungle that can only be survived by animals and plants that have mutated there. (When someone kills an animal, it starts to rot, and the jungle spreads).

##### Column - 4 -

###### Item 1 - Broken

This world is broken, like a cup. There are shards of the old world and places of nothingness (as if there were black holes). The world is literally broken - for example, a building might be split in half. Information can also be broken, the world might be missing a part of its magic (which it must have had), or beings don't have names, or they have only certain animals.

###### Item 2 - Labyrinth

The whole world is one big labyrinth with many dead ends. This can be literal, meaning the cities are designed this way, or it can be metaphorical, where the rules and social structure are so incredibly complex that they are like a labyrinth.

###### Item 3 - Court

In this world, there is one large court that decides on important matters. At this court, almost anything can be filed, and its decision is binding for everyone (and everyone respects it).

###### Item 4 - Flame

In this world, one can be infected by a demonic flame. It's a fire that can infect any being, just by touching the flame (or an infected being). The infected being burns, and the fire gradually spreads until it completely engulfs the being. And then, this being desires only to destroy all living things until it finally dies in terrible pain. A person can be freed from the fire only by another god or they must cleanse themselves somehow.

###### Item 5 - Necronomicon

In this world, there exists an evil that can be summoned by a book (someone just needs to read the activation spell). This evil is murderous and wants to destroy the world. The book contains several spells that can cause harm, destruction, and summon the dead.

###### Item 6 - Heroes

In this world, there are heroes who have their unique spells, which they use in battles against other factions.

In this world, three factions fight, influenced by three main forces:
- Red: Strength    
- Blue: Mind    
- Green: Agility (each hero has different levels of these forces)    

Heroes improve their abilities with items and by combining them into stronger artifacts.

##### Column - 5 -

###### Item 1 - Bosses

This world is divided by powerful bosses. Each one has a different personality, a different style of ruling, different abilities, and a different worldview. One, for example, could be a banker who sees everything through the lens of money. Another could be a scientist conducting experiments.

Each of them demands absolute obedience (for different reasons, e.g., one for survival, another behaves like a mobster). Each of these bosses owns a part of the world adapted to their profession (e.g., the scientist's area looks like a lab). The bosses hate each other. Whether they can tolerate each other depends on circumstances and whether they need each other. Otherwise, they are in constant war.

###### Item 2 - War

In this world, a massive war is taking place, and everything (industry, schools, art) is subordinated to this war.

###### Item 3 - Superhero Factory

In this world, superheroes can be created. It is a difficult and long process during which many people die, but in the end, someone with superpowers emerges. The purpose of these heroes is determined by the storyteller.

###### Item 4 - Drug

In this world, there exists a drug—something that a person needs, which gives them great advantages, but it also destroys them, turning them into a monster, and they can't live without it. This drug is rare—hard to find, and often someone has to be killed to get it.

###### Item 5 - Nightmare

In this world, there exists endless and indestructible evil that can materialize fear, i.e., what a being is afraid of. This evil transforms every dream into a nightmare, where it wants to imprison the being forever. However, there are warriors who fight against this nightmare by jumping into the unfortunate person's dream and freeing them. They find the exit or defeat a demon (created by the being's fear, e.g., a giant spider).

###### Item 6 - Transmutation

In this world, there exists magical alchemy that can combine multiple elements (or objects) into one. Matter first turns into energy, and it merges. This fusion is difficult, so the being must learn it well. In alchemy, the law of equivalent exchange applies, meaning the cost of fusing an object must be balanced by raw materials (and energy or the life of the character). They use magical diagrams for alchemy, where they place raw materials and start the reaction with their magical energy. Alchemists can only create what they have knowledge and raw materials for (e.g., a granite sword from a granite floor). Some of them serve the army, others are terrorists, or scientists studying alchemical fusion.

##### Column - 6 -

###### Item 1 - Asteroids

In space, there are asteroids that host various living (and non-living) biomes. They are enormous, seeming like they were ripped from a planet. They have cores made of liquid lava, flowing water, other elements, metal, sand, etc. Humans decided to teleport a few workers there to cultivate the asteroids and create a livable environment. These workers now have to struggle through hardships, fight with fauna, flora, lack of food, water, air—everything—because they must survive and prepare the asteroid for colonization.

###### Item 2 - God of Good and God of Evil

The gods of good and evil decided to end their battle by organizing games, in which chosen contestants fight for their side (good or evil).

###### Item 3 - Blood Magic

Magic or technology in this world is powered by blood. For example, when a character wants to create a fireball, they must use their own blood for it. (Modifications are up to the author, spells can look bloody or not).

###### Item 4 - Multi-Weather

In this world, there are multiple climate zones in one place. For example, one city might have winter with snow, another, a kilometer away, might have a desert, and a third might be a jungle.

###### Item 5 - Inverted World

The world is broken into floating islands that orbit the sun. The problem is that the sun is "down" and gravity pulls "down" as well. Thus, the illuminated parts of the islands are on the bottom, while the upper parts are dark with eternal night.

Living on the bright sides is extremely difficult because gravity pulls objects towards the sun, not the island. And the bottom part of the island has no floor or ground to catch a being.

Living on the dark sides is also difficult because of eternal darkness, but the island catches objects (so gravity works as expected in our world).

###### Item 6 - Mechanical Fortress

A mechanical castle roams the world. It has legs like a spider and doors that allow teleportation to any other door. The owner of this castle is involved in various societal changes and is sought after for their endless possibilities.

#### Group No. 2 (when a 3 or 4 is rolled)

##### Column - 1 -

###### Item 1 - Organization

In this world, there is a secret organization that either protects people from a hidden threat or consists of villains who want to achieve something secretly.

###### Item 2 - Isolated

The place is isolated from the world (planets, worlds). The characters crashed there on some vessel and can only leave with that vessel. They cannot call for help or request reinforcements—they only have each other and what is on the vessel.

###### Item 3 - Action Reaction

In this world, every action (activity, thought) has a reaction that works in the opposite direction. What kind of reaction depends on the world's setting. If it’s a dystopia, then it might be negative, or it could be determined by rolling dice.

###### Item 4 - Underground

In this world, there exist underground tunnels and catacombs built by monsters. These monsters are led by a demigod who communicates with the underground through a large heart. In this underground, the monsters have everything they need—food, entertainment, gold, and weapons. They emerge from the underground to terrorize the surroundings.

###### Item 5 - Transformation

When someone enters this world, they begin to change physically and mentally. For example, a being might enter a world of cats and gradually transform into a cat.

###### Item 6 - Young Gangs

In this world, there is a poor district that is the center of violence. Here, children learn to survive. Eventually, they join armed gangs that use them to transport drugs (or other criminal activities) and for bloody battles. (This could also be a district under the influence of a religious cult or the army).

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 1 - Guardian of Technology

In this world, advanced technologies are widely used, but they have their own intelligence and sometimes go crazy. Policemen or specially trained guardians come to tame this technology.

###### Item 2 - One Decides

In the world, there are several miraculous characters, but none is as powerful as one character who can change the universe with a single thought. After all, she created everything here, even the miraculous beings, without knowing it. This one powerful character rewrites the entire universe whenever she gets bored. To prevent her from accidentally destroying the entire universe, the miraculous characters must entertain her. Of course, they must not tell her anything.

###### Item 3 - Autopilot

In this world, there are cars (or other vehicles) that are intelligent and can drive without a driver. Therefore, no one learns to drive (since there’s no need).

###### Item 4 - Blessed

In this world, there are gods or demons who, for a price or service, grant beings magic or technology that others can only dream of. However, not everyone is worthy of the blessing. Both gods and demons choose (each according to their taste and rules). Some gods and demons fight against each other, others entertain themselves and play with people's lives, and some build something (e.g., their own utopia).

###### Item 5 - Incarnation

In this world, there are a few beings who have perfect memory of all their past (or future) lives. This memory activates at a certain age (e.g., 15) or is unlocked through a ritual. These beings know everything they did in all their past lives (or future lives), what happened to them, and how they died. Some use this knowledge for good, others for evil.

###### Item 6 - Religious

In the world, there is faith, religion, and priests. God exists (communicating either with people or priests), and priests can perform the magic of the god (or his miracles), and all rituals work precisely (for example, a ritual that is meant to cleanse a soul literally cleanses the soul). In this world, all problems are solved through faith and god.

##### Column - 3 -

###### Item 1 - Trick

In this world, magic does not exist. Everything is just a trick achieved through physical laws, mirrors, light, and fog. Each trick depends on the magician's skill and the audience's gullibility.

###### Item 2 - Fairy Tale

In this world, things happen as in classic fairy tales. They might have similar (or the same) stories, plots, characters, and conflicts. For example, like Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf.

###### Item 3 - Combat Cooking

In this world, when chefs want to cook something, they must first hunt and kill it. Therefore, chefs are also hunters of various monsters, whose meat (or plant matter) is highly prized, but it spoils quickly and cannot be preserved (only cooked).

Chefs can also compete in their craft.

###### Item 4 - Races

In this world, conflicts are resolved through races or sports that the whole world plays. For example, instead of war, a game of Tetris takes place. These races are bloody (for example, with Tetris - players are on a large field, and stone blocks fall on them that they must arrange). The results of the races are binding for everyone.

###### Item 5 - Mafia Rules

In this world, the mafia is the main government, ruling almost like a normal state. Of course, in a mafia style, because mafia crime is legal. Fighting for the old law (i.e., laws that prohibit crime like in our world, I hope) is illegal for the mafia.

###### Item 6 - Our World

The world in which the story takes place is similar to ours, but with some changes.

##### Column - 4 -

###### Item 1 - Video Games

The story takes place in the world of video games, where everything works according to the logic of video games. Whatever is in the program applies.

###### Item 2 - Hunter

The beings of this world are being hunted by someone. Either a higher being comes to hunt the inhabitants of this world for fun or for another reason.

###### Item 3 - Yin and Yang

In this world, the line between good and evil is thin. Every evil thing contains something good (a maniacal ruler protects the country and there is no hunger, but he kills people because they are different or disagree with him), and in every good thing, there is something evil (saving a person who then causes someone else's death just by existing, for example, because they are radioactive).

The decisions of the beings are also not purely good or evil—they might be better in some ways and worse in others.

Do I kill a creature that has poisoned the nearby area?

If yes, loggers will have a place to cut wood, and the village will prosper, but I will kill an intelligent and unique being.

If I don’t kill the creature? The village will starve because the loggers won’t have a place to cut wood, or it won’t sustain everyone.

###### Item 4 - Reassembled

This world was destroyed, as if broken into cubes. As characters move through the world, it reconstructs itself under their feet. As if the cubes fly from nothingness under their feet to create land, buildings, etc. And when the beings leave that place, the cubes return to nothingness.

###### Item 5 - Many Times

In this world, there are places where times converge. The past, present, and future coexist there simultaneously.

###### Item 6 - Invincible

In this world, there exists an invincible hero (or enemy) who can defeat anyone, destroy anything, and kill everything.

##### Column - 5 -

###### Item 1 - Remote

The given place is as remote as if it were on another planet—extremely far from home (or another main civilization). The home planet sent people to this very remote place to colonize it, and they succeeded.

###### pol. 2 - Mahou shoujo

In this world, girls (or boys) can make a contract to have one wish granted—but then they must fight against giant demons. These magical warriors do not have their souls connected to their bodies, but to a stone (which they wear as jewelry). They use this stone to transform from a normal state to a magical state (where they have access to all their unique spells and weapons).

###### Item 3 - Dual

There are two versions of the world with similar histories. They are dimensions that started the same but developed completely differently. For example, one side won World War in one, while the other side won in the other. In one world, the main character (or someone significant) is a hero, and in the other, a villain. Some beings can travel between these dual dimensions.

###### Item 4 - Simulation

The entire world is just a simulation, a massive software/hardware system to which all beings are connected, living their own lives within it. The surrounding world is entirely different, and the reasons for the simulation also vary. However, the beings have no idea.

The problem with the simulation is that due to limited memory, it can only simulate for half a year before the server needs to restart (which resets time). During this process, all beings' memories are erased. At least, that's how it's supposed to work.

Or, the entire world was destroyed by aliens. However, the aliens need the beings (for some reason), so they created a replica of the world (or part of it) on their alien planet. The entire replica is controlled by aliens—who can even modify and change it at night.

###### Item 5 - Bus

In this world, everything is extremely far apart, and all roads lead through dangerous places. Therefore, some beings earn their living by transporting goods and others to various locations.

###### Item 6 - Enhancement

In this world, a being can install something—a device—into themselves that improves them. They might get a robotic arm, a chip, or even a parasite that gives them magical abilities.

##### Column - 6 -

###### Item 1 - Underworld Evil (Pessimistic)

In this story, there exists a second world - the underworld - where people go after death. This world has its own rules (like our normal one), but it is pessimistically inclined, similar to hell. People suffer there, even if they were good during their lives. Demons drag spirits into this second world, delighting in their suffering. Souls in the second world are immortal and suffer forever. Sometimes they are released into the normal world as ghosts to do some task, but once the task is completed, the demons take them back and continue torturing them.

###### Item 2 - Mega Hero

In this world, there exists a mega hero who can solve even the most difficult cases. He is a walking army in one man, seemingly immortal and indestructible. However, he has a small army of helpers who work, fight, think, and clean for him, though he receives all the glory.

###### Item 3 - Phobia

What a being fears materializes in the most terrifying form.

###### Item 4 - Nature Advances

The world (or part of it) was destroyed by a catastrophe. The beings from these places disappeared, either died or fled. Nature returned to these places, struggling to survive there. Trees, grass grow again, and animals have arrived. It looks like a forest, but buildings from the past and many dangers (such as poison or radioactivity) still remain.

###### Item 5 - Animals and Humans

In this world, there are multiple races. Not only human, but also animal races that have their own societies, languages, economies, etc. They cooperate, trade, but can also fight with humans and other animal species.

###### Item 6 - Slaves

In this world, slavery exists, where one group of inhabitants is enslaved and forced to do hard labor for free. The inhabitants are enslaved for some reason—maybe because of how they were born (like in the movie Planet of the Apes), or because the wealthy beings own water, and the enslaved must earn it. Or it could be because some are intelligent, while others are uneducated (e.g., they can't operate complex machines or use magic).

#### Group No. 3 (when a 5 or 6 is rolled)

##### Column - 1 -

###### Item 1 - Secret Club

In this world, there is a secret club where members fight each other or use monsters to fight against each other and so on. This bloody sport is not done because the members hate each other but to stave off boredom or earn money. This club has its own rules, the members know each other, and maybe they have some rituals. However, they exist in strict secrecy.

###### Item 2 - Alternative

In this world, there exists an alternative to, for example, medicine, newspapers, or magic—these alternatives are widespread, people believe in them, and use them in their daily lives. The problem is that these alternatives are promoted by charlatans, they harm, and can even kill beings. But the beings do not believe this; they only believe in the alternative things and claim that the main (traditional) thing is harmful.

###### Item 3 - Guardian of Action

In this world, there is magic that guards a certain action. For example, a goddess of commerce who protects every transaction, and if someone lies or deceives a trader during a transaction, they receive a terrible punishment.

###### Item 4 - One Person

In this world, there lives one person who has experienced everything—for example, they fought in the First World War and the Second. They saw the cities being built. This person remembers everything and cannot be killed.

###### Item 5 - Submarines

In this world, travel is conducted by submarines that can dive into water, earth, lava (depending on the story). Without them, people cannot travel, trade, or transport goods. People live in enclosed complexes (because around them there is water or another element through which the submarines travel).

###### Item 6 - Contract

In this world, there exists a mysterious contract that beings can make with immortal demons. This deal is risky and has its consequences.

A being can choose one wish that the demon must fulfill. However, in exchange for this advantage, the being must bind themselves to the demon. Their souls merge, and the demon slowly begins to drain the being's life, who will die much sooner.

The demon gains a physical form, allowing them to live in the world among humans. They can transform into their demonic form, which is invincible, but during this transformation, the demon will drain the being much faster.

The nature of the relationship depends on the type of contract. The being and the demon can fight together against someone else. Or the being can become the demon's slave, carrying out its orders.

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 1 - Dark Lord

In this world, a cruel dark lord once ruled, who was defeated and sent to the underworld by a hero. However, his servants are trying to bring him back at any cost.

###### Item 2 - Control

In this world, there are beings who can control the elements that make up the entire world. Either through dance, martial arts, or other movements. They can control these elements but not create them—the element must be nearby.

###### Item 3 - Revival of the Monster

In a secret location, an experiment was conducted to revive a long-extinct monster or species of monsters (like dinosaurs). However, the experiment got out of control, and everyone who could, fled. Now the monsters are doing whatever they want.

###### Item 4 - Caste

In this world, people are divided into castes or groups. For example, they are divided by occupation (miners, engineers...), by role (guards, workers, scholars), or by whether they can use magic or not. Children born to parents in a certain caste must work in the same job as their parents.

###### Item 5 - Seers

In this world, there are seers who can see the future. The further into the future, the more hazy it is. So they see the near future much more clearly. Special offices use seers to prevent crimes (or for other purposes).

###### Item 6 - Twins

Every being has a twin born somewhere else. These twins have a slight awareness of each other—knowing if the other is alive or in danger. Various rules can apply to twins; for example, if one dies, the other turns into a demon. Or twins must always choose the same profession, otherwise, they will not succeed. Or twins must stay far apart, or they will die.

##### Column - 3 -

###### Item 1 - Great Empire

In this world, there is a great empire that spans several continents. Despite this, the empire strives to conquer and enslave more and more new territories.

###### Item 2 - Time Travel

In this world, time travel is possible. One can go to the past to fix something in the present or go to the future to see how their decisions will change the entire planet. Time travel can be achieved with the help of a time machine, which requires specific fuel and high speed.

###### Item 3 - Morphs

In this world, there are "morphs". These are creatures that infect the living (or dead) and turn them into monsters. These monsters then kill others. From the completely destroyed bodies, a substance emerges that spreads like an infection, modifying the destroyed bodies into weapons or organs that do something else. It's all part of a large organism that just consumes.

Morphs can be of any element or origin. They can be fungi, plants, sweets, or metal.

###### Item 4 - Colony

Beings came to this world for a single purpose: to colonize it. They only have basic survival items, essentially no roads, just some tents, and they struggle to survive. They must live mainly off nature, which provides everything but not for free.

###### Item 5 - Plant Demons

In this world, there are demons that use thick, creeping plants to achieve their goals. These plants are unnatural—they embody horror itself. Besides having eyes, they kill people. These monsters can only be destroyed by destroying their core (such as a crystal heart).

###### Item 6 - You Won't Age Here

In the world, there is a place where no one ages. When a being comes to this place, their biological time stops.

##### Column - 4 -

###### Item 1 - Virus

An unknown deadly virus has almost wiped out all beings. The survivors moved underground because it is the only safe place. They only go to the surface when they need something.

###### Item 2 - Only Discoveries

In this world, most problems have been solved, so the beings set out on a great journey through space (or worlds) to find new planets, elements, civilizations, and form alliances. Civilizations that are not ready for this are only observed by the beings, waiting for them to evolve. Yes, even in this world there are wars, but only between stubborn civilizations or those that want to assimilate everything for themselves.

###### Item 3 - Immortal

The main hero or a selected group of beings never dies, no matter what happens to them. The heroes indulge in horror-related things (studying monsters, pathology), are surrounded by creepy things, and overall do not fit into the given world. Everyone would like to exclude them from society, but they cannot because this selected group is useful, albeit eccentric.

###### Item 4 - Mafia

In this world, there is organized crime that is run like a business (selling weapons, drugs, using prostitution and gambling). The mafia is divided into families, each with its own boss who manages everything. These mafia families can be at war with each other or at peace, but each has its own visual style and way of ruling (e.g., Chinese mafia looks and behaves differently from Italian mafia).

###### Item 5 - Different World

This world has a completely different shape. It can be flat, like a cube, or like a cylinder. This world can be fragmented (islands floating in the air) or hollow (like our planet being hollow) and so on.

###### Item 6 - Boring Work

This world is full of routine and boredom. Everything is the same, everything works the same, and nothing deviates from the schedule. Even the work is monotonous and boring.

##### Column - 5 -

###### Item 1 - Forgotten

In this world, there exists magic, technology, craft, or place that has been forgotten how it works. Beings have gotten used to just using whatever is magical, and it somehow works. They don't know anything more about it and don't bother with it.

###### Item 2 - Fragments

In this world, there are certain fragments that, with the help of the last fragment, will unite and defeat a great evil.

###### Item 3 - Organism

The entire world is one big organism, with inhabitants serving as workers (like erythrocytes in a body). The organism can be organic or mechanical, and every part of the organism works solely for its survival.

###### Item 4 - Mask

In this world, there exists a magical mask that gives the wearer incredible strength. The mask brings out all the buried and suppressed qualities of the being. An extremely introverted being who loves comics becomes a superhero operating according to comic book logic.

###### Item 5 - School

Children attend a large school where they learn everything necessary about the world, history, and mathematics. Whether it’s a magical school, a military school, a school for video games, or technology, the storyteller decides.

###### Item 6 - Airships

Beings do not live on the surface of the earth but in airships or flying fortresses.

##### Column - 6 -

###### Item 1 - Underworld Good

In this story, there exists a second world to which people go after death. This world has its own rules (like our normal world), but it is optimistically inclined, similar to heaven. Evil people are in prison in this world.

###### Item 2 - Gladiators

In this world, there is a bloody gladiatorial sport where beings fight to the death. They might fight animals or have to go through some obstacle course.

###### Item 3 - Parasite and Medicine

In this world, there exists a very necessary medicine. However, this medicine is obtained by inserting a terrible parasite into a being, which drains their life and mentally destroys them.

###### Item 4 - Mega Corporations

Mega corporations have divided the entire world. Governments or states do exist, but they essentially have no power or are subordinate to the corporations. These corporations own a lot of land and beings, whom they can command. They exploit, manufacture—without regard for the planet. Corporations own the police, the army, and healthcare—everything.

###### Item 5 - Split World

The world has split into two mirror parts. One is in complete contrast to the other (if it is light in one, it will be dark in the other).

###### Item 6 - Riddle

The world is falling into ruin (or has a big problem), and the only thing that can save it is solving a riddle. It could be a text, a mathematical formula, or a treasure map. At the end is the solution to all the problems.
