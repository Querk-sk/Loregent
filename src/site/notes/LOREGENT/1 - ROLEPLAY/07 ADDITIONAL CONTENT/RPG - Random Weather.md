### Random Weather

Characters were walking through the forest when suddenly it started raining... ? The weather that the characters encounter is determined by the storyteller. They can roll the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Dice of Chance\|chance die]] and choose from the offered options. Or, if they prefer, they can just use it as inspiration.
