### Creature Collection
>[!warning] Early Draft

While many tabletop RPGs focus on killing monsters . . . sometimes you will want them on your side!

The Cogent System Community Project’s rules for taming have the following goals:

1. To ensure that in the narrative there is a plausible connection between tamer and tamed.
2. Provide a way to describe a Creature’s abilities and personality, without a complicated stat block.
3. To ensure Creatures do not become “Pokémon in the PC.” These rules acknowledge that taking on a creature requires commitment from the fictional character.
4. Ensure creatures do not replace the player characters.

#### Describing a Creature

To fulfill these goals, creatures that can be tamed are described with the following:

- Tier (Can be 0, 1 or 2) and Tier Attribute
- Compatible Tamer Vocations
- Creature Vocation and Creature Vocational Skills
- Favored Food Source
- Anti-Hostility Key

Not all creatures can be tamed by all people. Those creatures that can be domesticated are predisposed to value certain types of traits in a trainer. They can only be tamed by, and will only obey, a trainer that fulfills those traits.

#### Taming Prerequisites

Based on the narrative, some monsters will be **Inherently Hostile**. These, by definition, cannot be tamed. Some Creatures are Inherently Hostile by default, but fulfilling a requirement, called the **Anti-Hostility Key**, removes this hostility, making taming possible.

Creatures of Tier 1 or 2 will require the tamer to have 1 or 2 points respectively in their **Tier Attribute**. Thus a “Tier 2 – Intelligence” creature will only be tamable by someone with 2 points in intelligence.

Furthermore, certain creatures “connect” better with people of certain vocations. To tame the creature, you will need to succeed on a check with a compatible vocation. Finally, to have a chance at this check, you will need to offer the creature a bit of food from its favored food source as a token of good will. To ensure no creature becomes forgotten, there is a maximum number of creatures you can tame – you can have no more creatures than you have points invested in your vocation.

So, if you have 2 points in your vocation, you can control at any one time 2 creatures related to that vocation.

#### Taming Process

1. The *4 Prerequisites of Taming a Creature* are Fulfilled:
	- Creature is not / no longer *inherently hostile*
	- The tamer has *sufficient attribute points* for the creature’s Tier
	- The tamer is not over their *max creatures*
	- The tamer has a *compatible vocation*
2. The tamer offers a *lure* of the favored food source
3. The tamer succeeds on a *tame check* equal to 2 + the Creature’s Tier (so 3 for a Tier 1 Creature) using their compatible vocation.

#### What Can I do with my new Monster Friend?

Your creature, once tamed, is treated very similarly to a Vocation. If you need an Assist with a roll, and it is plausible that your creature could aid you, you can do an assist roll with your creature’s “Creature Vocation” just as you would with a human’s vocation. The pool for the assist roll will be the standard 3d6 + a number of d6 equal to the creature’s Tier + a number of d6 equal to the applicable skill of the creature.

Creatures should only be used for Assist Rolls. This is to ensure that the Player Characters are always the ones driving the main action.

Some examples below will illustrate.

>[!info] Some example Creatures and Their Uses
>
> - **Cerberus – Might 2**
> - **Compatible Vocations**: Any related to death, spiritual or physical, including soldiers, priests and doctors
> - **Hostility Key**: As guardians of the underworld, Cerberus have a grim respect for the death and often appear in our world when some necromantic force undermines the natural order of death. A Cerberus that sees you destroy an object of necromancy will come to respect you.
> - **Favored Food Source**: Meat
> - **Creature Vocation** 
> 	- Canine Guardian of Death - 3
> 	- Bite – 3
> 	- Track – 3
> 	- Follow Scent – 2
> 	- Jump - 2

This example, the Cerberus, is a great choice for a GM running a campaign about necromancy. The scenario’s plot explains why the creature would be there. Furthermore players, in the course of fulfilling the main plot, will be able to earn the creature’s respect. Thus, it is narratively plausible that a healthy relationship between tamer and tamed could occur.

Let’s say the Party has tracked the Necromancer down to an abandoned castle and they need to determine where in the castle the Necromancer is hiding. Before doing a Perception check themselves, the player could suggest to the GM that the tracking talents of the Cerberus could provide a valuable assist. They roll 3d6 (base) + 2d6 (for the creature’s Tier) + 2d6 (for the boxes in “Follow Scent”) for a dice pool of 7d6. As with a normal Assist roll, any successes could then be applied to the main roll.

>[!info] Here is a less spooky example of a creature:
> - **Trickster Pixie– Reflex 1**
> - **Compatible Vocations:** Any related to Charisma, performance, persuasion, or thievery
> - **Hostility Key:** Trickster Pixies are great pranksters (much to the chagrin of many adventuring parties). A Trickster Pixie that sees a character pull off a prank (on the Pixie themselves or on another character) will come to respect them as a kindred spirit.
> - **Favored Food Source:** Berries
> - **Creature Vocation** 
> 	- Fey Trickster - 3
> 	- Illusion – 2
> 	- Harvest Herbs – 3
> 	- Espionage – 2
> 	- Setting Fires - 2

This creature could provide some comic relief during a campaign. Perhaps on the way to fight some orcs the party wakes up to find that their gear has been stolen by the Trickster Pixie. To get it back a suitable prank would need to be pulled on the Pixie. Despite the momentary inconvenience, the party may find that it is useful to have a clever, small, and deviously smart ally, once a tame is completed. Let’s say the Party wants to sneak into the General’s Tent. Before doing the Stealth check, they use the Trickster Pixies skill in “Setting Fires” for an Assist. They want the Pixie to set fire to the camp to provide a diversion. They roll 3d6 (base) + 1d6 (for the creatures Tier) + 2d6 (for “Setting Fires”). Any and all successes above 3 can be added to the main Stealth roll.

#### Releasing Creatures

As discussed, you can have no more creatures than you have points in your own Vocation. Should you want to acquire a new creature but you have no slots remaining, you will need to release one of your creatures, or at least transfer it to a different player.

Animals take time, energy, and responsibility. It is not possible to control and do right by an endless amount of them, Furthermore, this limitation can ensure that different creatures impact the main plot.

#### Training Creatures

Creatures learn more slowly than Humans, and their ability to learn is greatly impacted by the skill of their creature. 

While it is possible to own a creature that has more points in its Creature Vocation than you have in your vocation, you will not be able to train it until your vocation is at least as trained as the creature’s vocation.

So, use our prior example, to add points to the Trickster Pixie’s skills, your vocation would need at least 3 points in it.

In campaign play, two Creature Skill Points are awarded at the end of each arc to each tamed creature that was present in the narrative (tamed or not) for at least half the chapters in that arc.

If a player wants to train a creature faster, two unspent “human” skill points can be traded for 1 creature skill point at any time.

Remember that a Creature’s Vocational Skills can not be greater than the points in the parent Creature Vocation. (As with humans)

If a player wants to give a creature a brand-new skill, as opposed to increasing skills it already has, this must be negotiated with the GM.

The new skill must be feasible for the type of animal the creature is, and furthermore there must be a narrative explanation as to how the tamer gave the creature this new skill.

#### Creature Death – Option 1

Creatures have plot armor (and I-want-the-player-to-still-be-friends-with me armor) and thus cannot be killed. All jokes aside, for some people who hate animal death in stories this may be the best option

#### Creature Death – Option 2

Tamed creatures are easier to kill than humans, or untamable creatures. Thus a human that scores a number of Victory Levels against a Creature in combat scores one more additional victory level than normal. Thus, a Level 4 Victory is what would be needed to bring about a pet creature’s death.
