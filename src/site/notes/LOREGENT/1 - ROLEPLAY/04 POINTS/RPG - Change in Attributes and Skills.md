### Change in Attributes and Skills

#### Point Transfer

Every character develops during the story. Some may become stronger, others may weaken, or they may gain new experiences. This story development is captured in the game through the so-called point transfer. Each character can transfer 1 point from any attribute to any other Attribute. This transfer is allowed only once every two played (story) years. Regarding [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skills]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specializations]], a character can transfer 1 point from any Skill to any other Skill, Talent, or Specialization, only once every 2 weeks.

Points can also be transferred such that an Attribute, Skill, or Talent reaches a value below 0. However, this requires the narrator's consent. (This does not apply to specializations).

> [!example]
> The word “Spell” includes: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|magic]], special aptitude, abilities, superpowers, or sci-fi technologies. We use the word “Spell” or the word “Magic” when we do not want to list all the abilities.

#### Increasing Attribute and Skill Points

A character can temporarily increase their attributes or Skills, for example, with the help of a Spell or by purchasing a better weapon (or tool). Additionally, our RPG system offers the possibility of permanent improvement. A character can permanently increase their Attributes and Skills by receiving 1 point from the narrator (which can be invested in an attribute or skill) directly, or by the character [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Training\|training]].

##### 1 point from the narrator

When characters complete a task given to them by the narrator, they can earn 1 point. The narrator decides whether this point can be added to their Attributes, Skills, Talents, or Specializations. However, it is usually a point for Skills (and so on), as 1 point for Attributes requires much greater effort or a much longer period.

>[!example]
>In the story of The Lord of the Rings, Frodo and Sam reached Mount Doom after a long and arduous journey and destroyed the ring. On their journey, they would receive 2 points in Attributes.

The narrator can decide to give the characters multiple tasks—one main and several side tasks—and upon completion of these tasks, the narrator can also give some additional reward. (More about tasks is in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]])
