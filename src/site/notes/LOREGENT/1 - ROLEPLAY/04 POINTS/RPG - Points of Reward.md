### Points of Reward

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] do not exist by themselves; it's a game mechanic through which a character receives a reward for defeating a group of enemies, completing a task, or for a player playing their character very well (like a good actor). These points are used to increase [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]], increase [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]], restore other points that the character previously used up (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]], etc.), or to obtain an item.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] are always given by the narrator and the player should use them as soon as possible.

The reward points rule applies only to characters controlled by players. Other characters controlled by the narrator do not receive any rewards.

#### Points for Combat

A character earns [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] when they defeat or kill an enemy or a group of enemies. Additionally, they can earn extra points for defeating special characters or completing special tasks.

>[!note]
>Defeating an enemy also means: knocking them out, forcing them to flee, or making them stop fighting. It doesn't have to be just killing.

Regarding defeating an enemy, the narrator has four options for setting the reward for characters. This can be either by the level of the enemy, the type of enemy character, the size of the group (of enemies), or the strength of the group (of enemies).

##### First Option: Points Based on Enemy Level

The narrator can use a luck die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter#Množstvo atribútov pre nepriateľa\|determine the strength of the enemies]] that attacked the characters. This strength of the enemies also determines the amount of reward when the characters defeat them.

All characters receive this reward after the battle and in the same amount (the reward is not divided).

- Level 1 = +2 reward points (number 6 on the luck die)    
- Level 2 = +4 reward points (number 5 on the luck die)    
- Level 3 = +6 reward points (number 4 on the luck die)    
- Level 4 = +8 reward points (number 3 on the luck die)    
- Level 5 = +10 reward points (number 2 on the luck die)    
- Level 6 = +12 reward points (number 1 on the luck die)

##### Second Option: Points Based on Enemy Type

Characters receive this reward as soon as they defeat (or kill) the enemy. However, if they wish, they can receive it at the end of the battle. The fate of the reward is decided by the narrator. The narrator can decide that the reward goes only to the character who killed the enemy, or that the reward is shared equally among all characters.

- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Extras\|Extras]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Unimportant Character\|Minor Character]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Supporting Character\|Supporting Character]] = +4 reward points for defeating or killing.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Important Character\|Important Enemy]] = +10 reward points for defeating, +20 reward points for killing.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Main Hero\|Main Enemy]] = +30 reward points for defeating, +60 reward points for killing.    
- Enemy [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Divine Character\|Divine Characters]] = +120 reward points for defeating.

##### Third Option: Points Based on Group Size

All characters receive this reward after the battle and in the same amount (the reward is not divided).

- One or two enemies: +4 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Small group of enemies: +8 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Large group of enemies: +16 reward points for defeating or killing

##### Fourth Option: Points Based on Enemy Group Strength

All characters receive this reward after the battle and in the same amount (the reward is not divided).

- Weak enemy: +4 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Average enemy: +8 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Strong enemy: +16 reward points for defeating or killing

##### Special Task

During combat, a character can receive a special task that they may or may not complete. For example, an enemy attacks a villager and tries to kidnap them, or an entrance to a building needs to be barricaded. These tasks are optional and not crucial for the “main” battle taking place but can help the villagers. Completing such a task rewards the player with reward points equal to the difficulty level of the task or based on the level of the enemy they had to defeat.

If a character performs a heroic deed during combat or accomplishes something incredible, they can also receive reward points. In this case, the number of points is determined by the difficulty level of the task, but the narrator can increase the total number of points.

##### Group Points Division

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] for combat are given to the entire group in full. This means the points are not divided among the players. For example, if a player is to receive 4 points for combat, each player in the group who participated in the battle also receives 4 points. An exception is the completion of a special task or heroic deed, or (if the narrator decides) the killing of a special enemy. In this case, the points are given to the player(s) who completed the special task during the battle.

#### Points for Completing Story Tasks

Characters can earn 1 full point from the narrator, which they can allocate to any Skill (talent, or specialization). However, the narrator may decide to give the characters another reward for completing a side story task or meeting special conditions of the main story task.

> [!example]
> The players must bring back a spy. Alive or dead. They receive a smaller reward for a dead spy, but it will be easier, while a live spy gives them triple the reward but is much more challenging.

The narrator determines the reward amount for each completed condition in the story task or for each completed side task. The following list can be used:

- Simple task: 3 points    
- Moderately difficult task: 6 points    
- Difficult task: 12 points

The narrator may also decide that characters receive points for completing side (optional or special) tasks based on the difficulty level of the task. If the task involves multiple dice rolls with multiple DLs, the narrator selects only the highest DL (or can decide to sum up all DLs). In that case, the reward would look like this:

- DL 3 = +9 reward points    
- DL 4 = +12 reward points    
- DL 5 = +15 reward points    
- DL 6 = +18 reward points    
- DL 7 = +21 reward points    
- DL 8 = +24 reward points    
- (DL x 3)

##### Main Task

The main task is something that players must accomplish. It is their primary goal. It spans multiple sessions and mainly several story days (it can involve story months or even years).

> [!example] 
>The characters must break into a magical bank. They want to steal a valuable artifact from there. The problem is that it's the most guarded city in the entire country, with many battle-hardened mages, numerous traps, and who knows what else. Moreover, the artifact is in a magical vault that not just anyone can open. The characters don't even know exactly where the artifact is. So, to complete the main task, they must gather all the information, accumulate resources, perhaps hire someone, and devise a foolproof plan.

The main task can be likened to a story from a book. It's something that unfolds throughout the entire novel.

##### Side Task

Alongside the Main Task, side tasks that relate to the main one may arise. A side task should not last more than three RPG sessions or more than a story month. A side task can address part of the Main Task or be something entirely outside the main story.

> [!example] 
> The players need to break into a magical bank with many magical vaults. However, they need a potion from the Alchemist. The Alchemist gives them a task before starting the potion. For example, the players must raid a bandit camp (partly because the Alchemist was attacked and robbed by the bandits, and partly because the camp contains ingredients for the potion). The bandit camp is quite large, so the players must plan the best way in and out.

> [!example] 
> (outside the main storyline)
> The players are awakened at night by ominous sounds. They discover that the village is haunted at night. They decide to (accept the side task from the local mayor and) cleanse the village of spirits.

A side task can be likened to a chapter in a book. It is something addressed over several pages, after which another issue is tackled.

#### Points for Fulfilling a Desire

Every character has something they desire, wants to achieve, or atone for. It can be something small or something very significant that they struggle with throughout their life. For fulfilling this desire, the character receives reward points based on the difficulty level of the given desire.

- DL 3 = +9 reward points    
- DL 4 = +12 reward points    
- DL 5 = +15 reward points    
- DL 6 = +18 reward points    
- DL 7 = +21 reward points    
- DL 8 = +24 reward points    
- (DL x 3)

> [!example]
> A character wants to quit smoking. This is a very difficult task requiring a lot of effort, with a DL of 5. When the character successfully quits smoking, they receive 15 reward points.

#### Points for Good Role-Playing

When a player portrays their character very well, like an actor in a movie, and does everything the character would do, even if it harms the character – the narrator can decide to reward the player. As a reward, they can give 4 reward points (or 8 for exceptional role-playing. Each level is in multiples of 4).

#### Points for Treasure

Characters can also earn [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] when they find treasure, gems, or something truly valuable. The narrator can decide whether the characters receive wealth points or an item. The number of points that the character (or their group) receives is based on the level of the treasure. This number can be multiplied by its size.

- Points based on treasure level:    
    - Level 0 = +2 reward points (Worthless) (number 1 on the luck die)        
    - Level 1 = +4 reward points (Common) (number 2 on the luck die)        
    - Level 2 = +6 reward points (Uncommon) (number 3 on the luck die)       
    - Level 3 = +8 reward points (Exceptional) (number 4 on the luck die)       
    - Level 4 = +10 reward points (Rare) (number 5 on the luck die)        
    - Level 5 = +12 reward points (Very Rare) (number 6 on the luck die)        
- Points based on treasure size:    
    - x 1 (Common size – the treasure fits into a small chest)        
    - x 2 (Uncommon size – the treasure fits into a closet)        
    - x 3 (Exceptional size – the treasure fits into a room)        
    - x 4 (Large treasure – the treasure fits into a house)        
    - x 5 (Very large treasure – the treasure is as extensive as a valley)

#### Use of Reward Points

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] are converted into other character points, which the player records in their table. This conversion must happen as soon as possible. If the player does not use the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]], they will be lost. (Conversion at the end of a combat encounter is sufficient.)

- _For 1 reward point, the character receives_    
    - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Wealth Points]], where the character receives 1 wealth point for 1 reward point.        
    - A useful item based on [[RPG - Item Points\|item points]], where the character receives 1 useful die for 1 reward point.        
- _For 2 reward points, the character receives_ (total points divided by 2)    
    - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]], where the character receives 1 training point for 2 reward points.        
    - A weapon based on [[RPG - Item Points\|item points]], where the character receives 1 attack point for 2 reward points.        
    - Ammunition replenishment, 1 piece for 2 reward points.        
    - Armor based on [[RPG - Item Points\|item points]], where the character receives 1 armor point for 2 reward points.        
- _For 4 reward points, the character receives_ (total points divided by 4)    
    - Restoration of 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]]        
    - Restoration of 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed point]]        
    - Restoration of 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|energy point]]

The player can allocate their points to multiple categories. They do not have to "purchase" from only one category, as long as they have enough reward points. If the player is short on reward points, the narrator decides what happens.
