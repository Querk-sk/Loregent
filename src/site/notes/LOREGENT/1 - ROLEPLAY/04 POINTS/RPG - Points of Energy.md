### Points of Energy

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]] determines how many spells a character can cast. So, how many fire rays, how many healing touches, or how many protective shields.

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] of energy**. These can be increased by items such as crystals, or they can be increased when the character invests in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] attribute. In such cases, the character gains an additional [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]].

#### Energy Consumption

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]] serve as a reservoir. After each spell, its energy points are reduced. When the energy points drop to 0, the character will use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] instead of energy points. The cost of spells, for both types of points, is determined by category (see below).

##### Small Useful Spells

**These are**: Lighting a candle, lighting a campfire, cooling beer, healing very small wounds (like a knife cut).

**Consumption**: These spells consume no energy.

##### Common Useful Spells

**These are**: All [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spells except small and large ones.

**Consumption**: 1 spell consumes 1 energy point.

##### Large Useful Spells

**These are**:
- Large spells that act at a distance of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance\|Further 10m - 100m]] and beyond.    
    - (For example, a healing spell that heals characters within a 300m radius)        
- Or any spell the narrator deems too powerful.    
    - (For example, a spell that restores all [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] of a character, or one that creates an elemental golem)     

**Consumption**: 1 spell consumes 2 energy points, or even 3, as determined by the narrator.

##### Combat Spells or Shield and Armor

**These are**: All combat spells, or spells that function as a magical shield, or spells that add armor, or any other combat advantage.

**Spell Consumption by Weapon Type**:
- 1 small weapon type spell consumes 1 energy point    
- 1 medium weapon type spell consumes 2 energy points    
- 1 large weapon type spell consumes 3 energy points    

**Armor Consumption**:
- 1 light armor consumes 1 energy point    
- 1 medium armor consumes 2 energy points    
- 1 heavy weapon consumes 3 energy points

>[!note]
Note When the type of combat spell cannot be determined, the spell consumes 2 energy points.
