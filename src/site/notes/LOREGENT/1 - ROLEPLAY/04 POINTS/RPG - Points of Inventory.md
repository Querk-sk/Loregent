### Points of Inventory

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] talk about how many items a character can carry. This includes holding in hands, wearing, putting on the back, or putting on feet.

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] of inventory**. These can be increased by items such as a backpack, or they can be increased when the character invests in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] attribute or sacrifices 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|point of speed]]. In each case (whether investing in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] or sacrificing a point of speed), the character gains an additional [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] inventory points.

The inventory rule applies only to characters controlled by players. The remaining characters controlled by the narrator have no inventory limitations.

#### Inventory Consumption

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] serve as a limit, indicating how many items a character can carry. When the next item will exceed the limit, character cannot take it, or they can sacrifice 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|point of speed]] until character needs additional space in inventory.

##### Small Items

**These are**: Rings, amulets, herb bundles, vials

**Consumption**: These items do not consume any inventory points.

However, when a character has 10 small items on them, such a "bundle" will consume 1 inventory point.

##### Common Items

**These are**: Any item that is not heavy or large (see below)

**Consumption**: 1 item consumes 1 inventory point.

##### Large or Heavy Items

**These are**:
- A large item is almost as large as the character (approx. 150 cm)    
- A heavy item is almost as heavy as the character (approx. 40 kg)    

**Consumption**: 1 item consumes 2 or 3 inventory points.

##### Weapon or Shield or Armor

**These are**: Weapons, Shields, or Armor that a character has ready for combat. That is - they are not stored in a backpack, but are in hand or somewhere on the body.

**Weapon Consumption**:
- 1-2 small weapons consume 1 inventory point    
- 1 medium weapon consumes 2 inventory points    
- 1 large weapon consumes 3 inventory points    

**Armor Consumption**:
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|light armor]] consumes 1 inventory point    
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|medium armor]] consumes 2 inventory points    
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|heavy weapon]] consumes 3 inventory points    

>[!note] 
>Note When the type of weapon or armor cannot be determined, the item consumes 2 inventory points.

#### Other Rules for Inventory Consumption

There are other ways to calculate inventory consumption. The narrator can decide which method to use, or whether to combine some methods.

##### By Weight

By weight, the inventory is calculated such that for each 1 kg of weight (or 1 meter of length) - 0.2 inventory points are consumed. This method is more suitable for realistic games, or games where survival is key (e.g., zombie apocalypse).

Conversion Table:

| ==Kg== | p.i | ==Kg== | p.i | ==Kg== | p.i | ==Kg== | p.i |
| :----: | :-: | :----: | :-: | :----: | :-: | :----: | :-: |
|   1    | 0.2 |   11   | 2.2 |   21   | 4.2 |   31   | 6.2 |
|   2    | 0.4 |   12   | 2.4 |   22   | 4.4 |   32   | 6.4 |
|   3    | 0.6 |   13   | 2.6 |   23   | 4.6 |   33   | 6.6 |
|   4    | 0.8 |   14   | 2.8 |   24   | 4.8 |   34   | 6.8 |
|   5    |  1  |   15   |  3  |   25   |  5  |   35   |  7  |
|   6    | 1.2 |   16   | 3.2 |   26   | 5.2 |   36   | 7.2 |
|   7    | 1.4 |   17   | 3.4 |   27   | 5.4 |   37   | 7.4 |
|   8    | 1.6 |   18   | 3.6 |   28   | 5.6 |   38   | 7.6 |
|   9    | 1.8 |   19   | 3.8 |   29   | 5.8 |   39   | 7.8 |
|   10   |  2  |   20   |  4  |   30   |  6  |   40   |  8  |
(p.i. = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] )

##### By Item Bundles

Inventory consumption can also be calculated according to certain “bundles” of items, where the impact of the item on inventory is determined by its category. These are:

###### Bundle of Natural Items

**Impact on Inventory**: No impact on inventory

**Description**: This "bundle of items" has no impact on the inventory. These are "things" that have grown on the character, such as cat claws, turtle shells, or tentacles. These species-specific "things" have their advantages, but they must also have disadvantages. (For example, a turtle shell increases natural armor by +3, but reduces [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] by -1)

###### Bundle of Basic Items

**Impact on Inventory**: minus 1 point per bundle

**Description**:

- A bundle of basic items does not include all items in the world, but only those that enable the character to perform an activity.    
- The bundle's name should reflect its contents – e.g., adventurer's bundle, herbalist's bundle, wizard's bundle, traveling doctor's bundle, etc.    
    - An adventurer's bundle might contain a sleeping bag, travel food, a torch, a small axe (for chopping wood), and so on. So, whenever the character needs to, for example, sleep in the forest, they simply "take out" the sleeping bag from the bundle.        
- Each bundle's contents must be approved by the narrator. The narrator should determine which activities the bundle covers. Each world is different, and in each world, "basic" needs are considered differently.  

**Advantages**:
- Can contain a very large number of items of a certain type.    

**Disadvantages**:
- Items from the bundle do not add any dice to rolls.    
- Items from the bundle can only be used to solve problems.    
- In combat, items can be used only in truly exceptional cases, with the roll result being the deflection of the enemy's attack.    
- The narrator may decide that some items are received only when the character rolls a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|luck die]] (this is described below under the heading [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Inventory#Luck Roll When Searching for Items\|#Luck Roll When Searching for Items]]).    
- Additional restrictions depend on the game's genre. In some games, the bundle may have an infinite number of uses. In other games, e.g., in a zombie apocalypse, it may be limited to a certain number of uses, and its weight may also be higher.    

**Cost of a Basic Bundle**: (for a zombie apocalypse)
- Cheap bundle with a single item    
    - For example, just 1 bread, 1 water, and 1 bandage.        
    - Cost 1 - 4, weight 1.        
- Common bundle with multiple items    
    - For example, 4x bread, 4x water, and 4x bandage.        
    - Cost 5 - 9, weight 2.        
- Expensive bundle with a large number of items    
    - For example, 10x bread, 10x water, and 10x bandage.        
    - Cost 10 - 14, weight 3.

###### Bundle of Special Items

**Impact on Inventory**: minus 1 point, maximum of 10 items or 10 kg.

**Description**:
- This is a bundle of items that allow the character to perform an activity while also providing dice for rolls or benefits. 
- Items in this bundle are listed individually, item by item – hence it is more of a list of things.    
    - For example, a bundle might include: Belt of Strength, Ring of Healing, Glasses of Perception, and so on.        
- In addition to useful items, the list can include damaging items (e.g., grenades) or items with a single purpose and one-time use (e.g., 1x teleportation scroll).    

**Advantages**:
- Items from this bundle can add dice, benefits, and attributes.    
- Items can be used in combat without limitation.    

**Disadvantages**:
- This bundle consumes 1 point even when it is not full. So, even 1 item uses up 1 whole point.    
- The number of items that can fit in the bundle is limited to 10 items or 10 kg. So, if the character has two items, each weighing 5 kg, the bundle is considered full.    
- Exceeding the weight or item limit deducts another point of speed from the character, thereby creating another bundle.

###### Weapon

**Impact on Inventory**: 
- Weapon in hand consumes 1 point per 2 points of damage. (That is = Weapon attack divided by 2, rounded up)
- When the weapon is stored in the inventory, it is considered a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Inventory#Stored Item\|stored item]] and falls under the category of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Inventory#Bundle of Special Items\|bundle of special items]].

###### Armor

**Impact on Inventory**: 
- Armor worn on the body consumes 1 point per 2 armor points (That is = Armor divided by 2, rounded up)
- When the armor is stored in the inventory, it is considered a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Inventory#Stored Item\|stored item]] and falls under the category of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Inventory#Bundle of Special Items\|bundle of special items]].

#### Backpack

A character can change the impact of inventory by purchasing a backpack. It adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]]. Alternatively, the character can purchase something like an exoskeleton. In that case, the character gains [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] (which can be exchanged for inventory).

These special items must specify how they change the impact on inventory and by how many points.

In any case, *the change in inventory weight* and *adding [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|points of inventory]]* is considered an attribute, priced at 4 points for 1 point.

Backpack or exoskeleton themselves do not have any impact on inventory as items (it's as if they weigh nothing).

##### Stored Item

Only items that the character has on them (in hand, on foot, or in a place where the item is readily accessible, e.g., bandits with a sword at their belt) are counted towards the character's attributes (such as attack, armor, inventory, etc.).

Items that are stored in a backpack, on a horse, in a treasury, on a ship, etc., are not counted towards the character's attributes (for example - the belt of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]+1 in horse inventory will give character 0 points inf [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]).

The character is burdened by the item's weight only when item is on their body or in their backpack. When a character stores an item outside their body, e.g. on a horse, the item no longer burdens the character with its weight. Such an item is called a "stored" item.

This advantage, however, comes with a drawback. If the character wants to use their stored item as quickly as possible, e.g., during combat, they must be near the place where they store their items. Retrieving a stored item takes 2 rounds. If the character wants to use a weapon immediately, they must roll an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] skill check against a challenge level of 3. If they fail to meet this challenge level, they cannot use the item in that round. Moreover, the number of rounds it takes for the character to retrieve the stored item to use, it's equal to how much they missed the challenge level by.

##### Dropping the Backpack

A character carrying heavy items or bundles in their inventory may lose speed points and possibly dice in rolls. If the character encounters a dangerous situation and wants to react immediately with full strength, they can drop their heavy backpack.

When the character drops the heavy backpack, all the negative effects are nullified. (The character can only drop the entire backpack – meaning all the items in it.)

To drop a heavy backpack, the character must wait 1-2 rounds (depending on the number of items and the complexity of their binding), or roll an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] skill check against a challenge level of 3. If they succeed, they can react immediately in that round. The number of rounds it takes to discard the excess load equals how much they missed the challenge level by. The player cannot roll again [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] to drop their heavy inventory.

Naturally, if the character does not have the heavy backpack on, they cannot use the items stored in it. The narrator decides on the possibility of using items from a dropped backpack.

#### New or Forgotten Items

When it comes to items that were not considered when creating the character (e.g., whether a climber has pitons and carabiners for securing a rope), or items the player wishes to have (e.g., wants to throw a jug of water at the enemy), or items the player has already used but needs more of (e.g., more ammunition) - the so-called [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] is used to determine if the character has such an item (or rather, if the character has found such an item). If the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] is successful, the character finds the item and can use it. If the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] is unsuccessful, the character does not find the item or finds an item which further complicates the situation.

##### Result of the Luck Roll When Searching for Items

The character is looking for something:

1. Huge Misfortune    
    - Either the character does not find the item.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but using it increases the challenge level by plus 2 because it is broken.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but to use it, they must solve a problem at challenge level 3.        
    - Or the character must assemble or activate the item. Assembling or activating it will also have a challenge level of 3.        
2. Great Misfortune    
    - Either the character does not find the item.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but using it increases the challenge level by plus 1 because it is somewhat broken. 
    - Or the character finds the item, but to use it, they must solve a problem at challenge level 2.        
    - Or the character must assemble or activate the item. Assembling or activating it will also have a challenge level of 2.        
3. Slight Misfortune    
    - The character finds the item, but to use it, they must solve a problem at challenge level 1.        
    - Or the character must assemble or activate the item. Assembling or activating it will also have a challenge level of 1.        
4. Slight Fortune    
    - The character finds the item and can use it immediately.   
5. Great Fortune    
    - The character finds the item and can use it immediately. This item reduces the challenge level by 1 or adds 1 win to the roll.        
6. Huge Fortune    
    - The character finds the item and can use it immediately. This item reduces the challenge level by 2 or adds 2 wins to the roll.
