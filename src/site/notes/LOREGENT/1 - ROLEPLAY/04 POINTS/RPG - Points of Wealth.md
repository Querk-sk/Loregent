### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] refer to the amount of money a character carries. The number is determined by the narrator, and unless stated otherwise, every character receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6]]0 Points of wealth at the beginning of the game. These points can be increased when the character invests in the attribute [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] and can further be increased by selling, stealing, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward\|completing tasks]].

#### How much money should the character receive?

At the beginning of the story, each character receives a certain amount of money. Below is a list of wealth levels. The narrator determines the character's wealth level according to this list.

- Homeless: (0 - 10)
- Low-income: (11 - 20)
- Average income: (21 - 40)
- Good income: (41 - 80)
- Upper class: (81 - 160)
- High class: (161 - 320)
- Wealthier: (321 - 640)
- Rich: (641 - 1,280)
- Very rich: (1,281 - 2,560)
- Extra rich: (2,561 - 5,120)

If the narrator can't decide how much money a character should receive, they can roll dice, for example, when characters meet a wandering merchant. The number rolled on the dice is multiplied by 10 to determine how much money the other character (such as the wandering merchant) has. If it’s a very wealthy character, the narrator can roll multiple dice.

#### Consumption of wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] (p.w.) in our system are considered as money, such as euros, coins, credits. This is because they are spent in the same way as those mentioned euros, coins, credits. So if something costs, for example, 10 p.w. and the character has 30 p.w. in their pockets, after purchasing the item, the character will have only 20 p.w. left.

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the challenge level by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).       
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

##### For Example

> [!example]
>- Leather armor, which adds 3 points of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor\|armor]] -> price 6
>- Long axe, which increases max damage by 2 -> price 4
>-  Bandage, which adds 3 dice to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Liečenie zranenia\|natural regeneration]] -> price 3
>- Healing potion, which immediately adds 2 health points -> price 8

##### Quality and Price

If the narrator wants, they can adjust the final price according to the quality or rarity. If the item is rare or of higher quality, the price increases. And if the item is damaged, or is something abundant (like sand in the desert), the price decreases.

- Trash - 16 p.w.
- Horrible / Damaged - 8 p.w.
- Bad / Very abundant item - 4 p.w.
- Worse / Abundant item - 2 p.w.
- Normal + 0 p.w. (base for all items)
- Better / Unusual + 2 p.w.
- Quality / Exceptional + 4 p.w.
- Good / Rare + 8 p.w.
- Very rare + 16 p.w.

##### Merchant Markup

The final price can also be increased by the merchant's markup. To determine it, one, two, or three dice are used (depending on how much the merchant wants to earn). The narrator rolls the dice and the value rolled:

- is added up and added to the final price of the item (when the character buys from the merchant),
- or subtracted from the final price (when the character sells something to the merchant).

#### Price in the Story

When a character wants to buy a room in a hotel, sell a car, or buy a beer—how much will they pay? The narrator can decide how to proceed.

##### First Option

The first option is that the price of an item or service is determined by the number of points (dice, or attributes) a character receives. For example, when a character rents a room in a hotel, they do so to rest and thus restore their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. The price will reflect the number of points the character restores. If it is an item that brings some benefit to the character (for example, a nice shirt adds dice to the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] skill), the number of points (or dice) the item brings to the character determines the final price.

##### Second Option

The second option is that the price is determined according to the scale:

- Cheap: 1 - 5
- Common: 5 - 9
- Pricier: 10 - 14
- Expensive: 15 - 19
- and so on

##### Third Option

The third option is that the narrator looks up the price of an item in our real world, divides it by 30, and rounds up. The minimum price of an item is always 1 p.w.

>[!example]
>A new car costs 22,000 €, so the price should be around 733 p.w.

Of course, the same applies as above. If an item or service is rare (or common) in the given world, the narrator can adjust the price of the service (see section [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Quality and Price\|Quality and Price]]).

#### Earning points of Wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] increase when a character sells something, completes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Body za splnenie príbehovej úlohy\|a task]], receives a reward for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Prvá možnosť Body podľa úrovne nepriateľov\|defeating an enemy]], or performs a job. They receive their money directly from other characters. The money is added just like during consumption. So if a character has 20 p.w. and sells an item for 30, they will have 50 p.w.

#### Negotiating Prices with a Merchant

The price of an item in a shop can be lowered or increased in favor of the character. To do this, any [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used, rolled as an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active conflict]] against any of the merchant's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute. The price with the merchant can also be changed through simple conversation, or the character can solve the merchant's problem.

If a character decides they want to negotiate the price with the merchant, they choose the skill they will use (any from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used) and state how much they want to adjust the price in their favor (e.g., lower the price when buying, or increase the price when selling). For each point the character changes their price, the merchant gets that many wins added to their roll. This number is divided by 2.

> [!example] 
> For example, a character wants to change the price (in their favor) by 
> 
> 1 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 2 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 3 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 4 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 5 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 6 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 
> and so on

> [!example]
> - A character wants to buy an axe that costs 6.
> - The character wants to lower the price by 4 points.
> - The merchant gets 2 wins in their roll.

- When the price negotiation is won by the character, the price is adjusted by the amount they wanted.
- When the price negotiation is won by the merchant, the price is adjusted unfavorably for the character by the number of additional wins the merchant rolled. These wins are then multiplied by 5.

> [!example] (...continuing from the previous example)
> - The character rolled 4 wins
> - The merchant rolled 3 wins + 2 that they received
> - The merchant, therefore, rolled 1 more win than the character
> <br>
> - If the character wanted to buy the item, its price increases by 5 points
> - If the character wanted to sell the item, its price decreases by 5 points

Price negotiation can only be rolled once.
