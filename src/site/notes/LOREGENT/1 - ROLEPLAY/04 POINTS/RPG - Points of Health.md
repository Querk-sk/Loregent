### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]
( or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/HP\|HP]] )

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] indicate how much damage a character can take before dying. The number of health points is determined by the narrator.

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health]]**. These can be increased by items such as organic shields, magical amulets, and the like. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] also increase when a character invests points into [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]].

#### Health Consumption

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] serve as a cap. With each damage taken, the character's health points decrease. When health points drop to 0, the character dies (unless the narrator decides otherwise).

A character can get injured in battle – that is, when they lose a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat#Combat Rounds\|combat round]] and the enemy injures them. A character can also get injured if they fail the challenge level in a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Quick Reaction\|quick reaction]] (for example, falling from a great height), or they can get injured from an ongoing condition (such as being poisoned).

Each damage received by the character **does not reduce** the number of dice they can use for their roll. _(This rule is still being tested.)_

- Injury 1 = - 0 dice    
- Injury 2 = - 0 dice    
- Injury 3 = - 0 dice    
- Injury 4 = - 0 dice

>[!note]
>- The narrator can treat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] as a resource - where points are spent when injured.
>- Alternatively, they can be seen as a threshold - where the character accumulates injuries, and when the amount of injury equals the health points, the character dies.
>- Which approach the narrator chooses is up to them, our RPG system doesn't mind either way.

#### Health Protection

Health can be protected during the game by:

- **Before the dice roll**, using a sacrifice to gain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|advantage]] (so that numbers 3, 4, 5, or 6 count as victories on the dice).    
- **After the dice roll**, using [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|sacrifice]] to add victories.    
- **During combat**, health can be protected, besides the mentioned options, by choosing a suitable [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]].    
- Or **after combat** by using armor, which absorb damage.

#### Healing Injuries

When a character is injured, how do they heal?
- Natural regeneration (where the body heals itself),    
- Treatment (where the character heals themselves, or someone else comes to treat the character),    
- With the help of items (when the character drinks a health potion),    
- Or with the help of machines (surgical chamber).

##### Natural Regeneration

Injury heals with rest, where the character sleeps through the night (about 8 hours). The narrator can decide whether the character regenerates 1 health point per night, or less (depending on the story and the difficulty of the game).

Alternatively, the character must roll dice for their skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]” against a **challenge level of 3** for their regeneration. (The narrator can adjust this level, for example, if the character is also poisoned, it can be increased).

In this case, the rolls are as follows:
- 3 dice as a base    
- plus [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]    
- plus [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]    
- plus (dice for regenerative items, such as medicines)    
- ! The number of dice for regeneration is never reduced due to missing [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] !

The number of health points healed is equal to the number of victories rolled over the difficulty level.

The narrator can decide that for their story, it is better if the regeneration is slower. For example, instead of 1 health point, the character regenerates only 0.1. So, if there were 6 victories, it would mean 0.6

##### Regenerative Items

Regenerative items are items that help a character in healing. During rest, only one item can be used.

The attributes of regenerative items are:
- **Usage** - how many times the item can be used -> i.e., for how many rests it can be used. If the item has infinite usage, the cost is increased by 10.    
- **Regeneration** - adds dice to the roll    
- **Simplification** - reduces the challenge level for the regenerative roll.    
- **Healing** – adds whole health points

> [!example]
>* Bandage -> usage 3x (3 dice rolls), adds +1 die to regeneration or healing
>* Injection to stop bleeding -> usage 1 dice roll. Regeneration simplification 2 (i.e., minus 2 CL)
>* Ring of regeneration – heals 0.5 of an injury each night
>* Aura of slow healing - adds +2 dice to the regenerative roll

###### Cost of Regenerative Items

The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|cost]] is calculated the same way as for other items (but to save you the trouble of looking it up):

- **Adds dice to the roll = attribute x 1** (i.e., usage and regeneration)    
- **Adds victories to the roll or reduces CL = attribute x 2** (i.e., simplification)    
- **Restores health points directly = attribute x 4** (i.e., healing)

> [!example]
> * Bandage, which has 3 uses and adds +1 die = cost 4
> * Injector, which reduces CL by 2 = cost 6
> * Ring of regeneration – heals 0.5 of an injury each night – this depends on whether the narrator counts 0.5x4 or 5x4.
> * Aura of slow healing - adds +2 dice to the regenerative roll, with "infinite" usage = cost 12

#### Treating Another Character

An injured character can be treated by someone else. The character who treats someone rolls the dice against CL 3:

- 3 Dice as a base    
- plus Skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]”    
- plus [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] focused on healing, without which the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]], or at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|great disadvantage]] in the case of complex healing or deep wounds that need a specialized doctor.    
- plus dice for regenerative items

>[!warning]
When one character wants to treat another character with their spell, only the spell dice roll is used, according to the rules of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]].

An injured character can be treated with a skill (and talent) a maximum of once every 24 hours. The injured character can then heal themselves through natural regeneration (even if they were treated by another character). However, not immediately—maybe after 1 hour, or only at night.

As for the evaluation of regeneration, the same rules apply as mentioned above. The number of health points healed is equal to the number of victories rolled over the CL. The narrator can decide that for their story, it is better if the regeneration is slower. For example, instead of 1 health point, the character regenerates only 0.1. So, if there were 6 victories, it would mean 0.6.

#### Health Problem

In the story, things can happen that harm the character or complicate their life by causing a health problem. When this happens, the narrator first decides whether it will be a "life-threatening" or "annoying" problem. Then it is determined whether it is "acute" or "chronic." And then it is determined what is needed for the character to heal.

(Based on what is consumed during the health problem, we divide the problem into:)
- **Life-threatening** health problems give the character injury points. For example, for each round, they receive 1 injury point. The life threat can be significant (where they receive, for example, 2 or 3 injury points), and some injuries can be blocked by armor (for example, fire cannot be blocked by armor, but a strangling snake can be blocked).    
- **Annoying** health problems reduce the number of dice the character can roll. These are complications like blindness, difficulty walking, or difficulty breathing. An annoying health problem itself never reduces [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] (like poison, for example).

(Based on how quickly the health problem needs to be addressed, we divide the problem into:)

- **Acute** problems are those that need to be addressed here and now. For example, the character is _currently_ on fire, and if they do not extinguish it, they will lose [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]].    
- **Chronic** problems will bother the character longer, and their effect does not need to be addressed immediately (and cannot be addressed immediately here and now).

**Healing** or solving the problem depends on the problem itself. Therefore, the narrator must specify what the character must do to get rid of the problem. To mitigate the effects of either life-threatening or annoying problems, the skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]” is rolled against a challenge level set by the narrator. The minimum CL is 3.

The length of healing or solving the problem also depends on the problem. In the case of fire, it is enough if the character jumps into water (i.e., 1 round is enough to solve the problem). In the case that the character is poisoned, the poison's effect must be suppressed several times (for example, when the character suppresses the poison's effect 3 times, the poison disappears from their body). In the case that the character has a severed hand or heavy bleeding, they must save themselves with an item that stops bleeding (for example, using a tourniquet. In this case, the challenge level must be overcome to know if the solution to the problem is successful). The solution to the problem and its duration is determined by the narrator.

> [!example]
> 
> - Severe bleeding
> 	- Life-threatening problem, acute
> 	- The character loses 1 health point per round if the bleeding is not stopped.
> 	- To treat, a tourniquet must be used. Challenge level is 3. The character can roll only once per round.
> 
> - Burning (the character is on fire)
> 	- Life-threatening problem, acute
> 	- The character loses 2 health points per round if not extinguished.
> 	- To treat, water must be used (the character can jump into a river) – the character will be extinguished and will no longer lose health points in the next round.
> 	- If the character has no water, they can drop to the ground and try to extinguish themselves. They must roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] against a challenge level of 3. The character is extinguished only if they pass the challenge level. The character can roll only once per round.
> 
> - Frozen (the character is in a block of ice)
> 	- Life-threatening problem, acute
> 	- The character's health is reduced to 1 unless they thaw.
> 	- A heat source must be used for treatment. In the case of strong heat, the character will thaw in 3 rounds. In the case of weak heat, in 6 rounds.
> 
> - Slow poison (the character is poisoned)
> 	- Annoying problem, chronic.
> 	- The character feels unwell, has difficulty walking, and is dizzy. Their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] are reduced to minus 2.
> 	- Slow poison is part of a ritual and will naturally fade after 3 days.
> 	- The effect of the poison can be suppressed by rolling the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]], which is rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|an assist roll]].
