### Other points

The narrator may decide to use points other than those used in our RPG system. These "other" points are used in various situations and denote different states. Therefore, each point has its own rules.

#### Points of Offensive

**Pain**

Pain points are used when an attacker causes pain to their victim instead of injury. The attacker can exchange 1 level of victory for 1 pain point (which the victim receives). When the victim accumulates 10 pain points, they can no longer fight and fall out of the battle because the pain becomes unbearable, and the character faints. The victim can use 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] to "cleanse" themselves of 3 pain points.

**Stress**

Pain does not have to be physical. Therefore, the narrator may decide to use Stress points, which are added when the attacker attacks their victim using [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] skills or when they use the victim's phobia against them. When the victim accumulates 10 Stress points, they can no longer fight and fall out of the battle because the stress becomes unbearable, and the character faints. The victim can use 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] to "cleanse" themselves of 3 stress points.

**Heat (element)**

If the narrator uses elements in their story, they can add Heat points (or Cold points, etc.) to a character. These points are added when the attacker uses a weapon with an element (e.g., fire) against their victim. When the victim accumulates 10 element points, they can no longer fight and fall out of the battle because the effect of the element becomes unbearable, and the character faints. The victim can use 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] to "cleanse" themselves of 3 element points.

#### Points of Defense

**Advantage**

Advantage points are accumulated when the attacker does not use their victory levels during their winning turn and simply stores them. These points can be used later if the attack roll fails or if the attacker wants to completely crush their enemy. The narrator has complete freedom in determining how many advantage points a player can store and for how many rounds.

In terms of the story, the successful attacker dodges the attack during the winning turn. The more they dodge, the dizzier the victim becomes. The attacker later uses this for a devastating blow.

#### Magical Essences

Some spells may require an essence or energy for their activation. For example, ice spells may require an ice essence, while fire spells require a fire essence. The narrator can decide whether the essence is necessary for casting the spell or if it just enhances the spell. Each essence is consumed after use.

#### Points in Story

**Water, Food, Sleep, etc.**

The narrator may decide to track how often characters eat, drink, and sleep in their story. Characters may be assigned 5 points for food (or also for water and rest). These points will be spent based on the number of hours that pass, or the narrator can use them to limit time (for example, a character can roll the dice only 5 times in 1 day because they have 5 rest points. Once the character uses their 5 points/rolls, it becomes night, and the character must sleep).

These points can also be used in a post-apocalyptic survival game. When these points run out, speed points are used, and then [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] (for example, a character has 10 food points. When they drop to 0, the character dies. To earn food points (if they don't have food with them), they must spend 1 speed point to "earn" 2 food points. 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] "earns" 4 food points (or fills all speed points â€“ depending on the narrator's preference). Food points can be spent based on time, with 1 food point consumed every 2 hours, or they can be spent day by day).

Of course, this all depends on the narrator and their game. The food system in a zombie apocalypse will function differently than in a fantasy setting.
