#### Inventory System - Making a TTRPG From Scratch

(Bard and transcript)

**The video discusses how to create an interesting inventory in RPG games.**

- **Problem with Existing Systems:** The video's author, Adam, criticizes inventories in games like Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) because item weight does not always correspond to their importance. For example, a wizard needs little equipment to fight, while a warrior needs much more to be effective. D&D's solution is to expand the inventory and use magical items to carry more things, which, according to Adam, only worsens the problem because players no longer need to think about what they carry with them.    
- **Important Factors for an Interesting Inventory:** Adam argues that players should make meaningful decisions about their inventory. Two key factors that affect whether the inventory is interesting are the importance of items and their cost (in money or other resources).    
- **Trophy Gold as a Good Example:** The game Trophy Gold has a "Burden" system, where every item and spell has a maintenance cost that you must pay after each adventure. If you don't pay, you fall into debt and eventually lose the game. In Trophy Gold, there is also less money to gain, which forces players to minimize their inventory and use all the items they have.    
- **Inventory in the game Explorers RPG:** Adam is working on his own game, Explorers RPG, and his goal is for the inventory to serve as the characters' "preparedness." He wants players to be rewarded with easier encounters if they are well-prepared. The inventory is divided into three categories: basic items, specialized items, and artifacts. Basic items are better than nothing but are not ideal (e.g., a torch versus an oil lamp). Specialized items are suitable for one purpose (weapons, armor, climbing ropes). Artifacts are unique items that change the game (e.g., a key that opens portals). Players have a limited number of inventory slots and must choose items based on the challenges they expect. The goal is to make players think strategically about what they take with them.
