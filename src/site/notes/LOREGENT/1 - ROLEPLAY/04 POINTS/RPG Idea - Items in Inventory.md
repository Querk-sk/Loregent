### Items in Inventory

Each character can have two types of items in their inventory: designated and non-designated.

Designated items are those used to solve problems from a specific profession or trade (e.g., a lock-picking set for thieves that only thieves can use). These items have designated attributes.

Non-designated items are those used for a general problem and do not have specified attributes.

Each character can have the following designated equipment:

Každá postava môže mať toto určené vybavenie :
- Hands, which can hold 2 designated items (usually a weapon and a shield)    
- Body, which can carry 1 designated item (usually armor)
- Pockets, which can hold 2 designated items

In addition to all this, the character has several empty slots. They can place new items in these slots between scenes (e.g., a 3-meter rope). These items remain until the character uses them or deletes them. The number of empty slots that can be filled with non-designated items is calculated as 3 + STR. To carry more, the character must take on what is called a burden.

Burden: For each level of burden, the character loses 1 die from the roll. Each level of burden adds new empty slots to the character, the number of which is 3 + STR.

>[!Example]
> - The character has STR 2, so they have 5 empty slots to place items. (3 + 2 STR = 5)
> - The character took on 4 levels of burden, and therefore has 20 empty slots to place items. (4 x (3 + 2 STR) = 20)
> - Therefore, the character loses 4 dice from each roll.
