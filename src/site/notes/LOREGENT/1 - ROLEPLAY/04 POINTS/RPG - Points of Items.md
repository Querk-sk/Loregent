### Points of Items

The character can create any item, provided they have the talent, sufficient materials, and the necessary tools. The character must specify exactly what they want to create. The narrator will then specify the materials needed, the tools required, and whether dice will be rolled once or multiple times, as well as how many story hours the creation of the item will take.

The skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" or "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]" is used to create the item. Other skills can also be used for the creation of the item, but only as an "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|supporting roll]]" (e.g., the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" when forging a sword)

> [!note] Skills and Item Creation
> **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]** is used for creating items that only require knowledge and skilled hands, but not complex machines. Examples include brewing potions, embroidering magical runes into cloth, creating a statue (which a magician later animates), stringing beads (to make a magical necklace), forging a sword, making a bow, and so on.
> 
> **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]** are rolled when the character is creating a machine or using a machine to create an item (e.g., a replicator that makes medicine, a CNC machine that cuts a knife from a piece of steel, an analytical mixer that mixes a potion).
>
> So if, for example, a blacksmith wanted to make a sword and used a machine for it, such as a computer-controlled lathe (or something similarly complex), then " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]" would be rolled because the machine needs to be programmed. If the blacksmith used their hands to make the sword, " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" would be rolled (in this case, " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" could also be rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|supporting roll]]).

#### Challenge Level for Creating an Item

The character specifies what they want to create and what attributes the item should have. Based on this, the difficulty level is calculated according to the following list:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/04-points/rpg-points-of-wealth/#item-price" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

The difficulty level can be adjusted by the narrator if the character is making a complex item or if they have weak tools or are missing a minor component (e.g., one clip instead of two). Better auxiliary items like a modern blacksmith's forge (instead of a regular forge), a higher-quality hammer, etc., reduce the difficulty level. The amount of reduction is determined by the narrator.

After rolling the dice, all wins are summed. If the number of wins is lower, the item is created with worse attributes or no item is created at all, and the materials are destroyed.

##### Bonus Points for Items

A character can earn additional wins if they use higher quality or rarer materials (e.g., using titanium instead of iron) or if they enhance their basic materials (e.g., creating a purer alloy).

> [!example]
>  - The character is going to make an axe.
>  - They are a blacksmith and have all the materials. Some materials have also been enhanced.
>- They rolled [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] "blacksmith" +[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]]+3
>- Against a difficulty level of 3 and achieved, say, 6 wins.
>- This grants them 3 item points.
>- Enhanced materials provide, say, 4 wins (iron bar 2, better wood 1, better axe handle 1)
>- Thus, the character gains a total of 7 wins.

Regarding rare materials, the narrator determines how many wins they add to the final result.

For enhanced materials, the character must enhance them themselves (e.g., by refining steel) or buy them from a merchant. Enhancing materials (which must be approved by the narrator) is done in the same way as a roll for creating an item. Because it involves creating a better material, the difficulty level may be higher or lower, depending on the circumstances and tools used.

#### Crafting with a Blacksmith

A character can have an item created by a blacksmith (or another specialist). This option works the same as "normal" item creation, with the difference that attributes are paid for with money. In addition to this amount, the blacksmith's fee and the cost of materials that the blacksmith must purchase to create the item are added.

#### Item Enhancement

This involves improving a property or increasing an attribute of an item. A character can enhance an item only if allowed by the narrator and if they have the necessary [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] that can be used for creating or enhancing items, such as a blacksmith or an herbalist.

Enhancing an item is done in the same way as creating a new item. The character specifies what they want to enhance and by how much. To enhance an item, the character needs components. Not raw materials, but actual parts or components that can be replaced or installed in the item. (Necessary components can be created from raw materials.) If the character has everything needed, the tools, or access to a suitable workshop, they can start the enhancement, which can be completed within two hours. It is important to note that item enhancement is irreversible, and the player might even damage their item.

In this case, the skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]" is used. Other skills can be used only as " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|supporting rolls]]" (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]] " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" when forging a sword).

The difficulty level is determined in the same way as for item creation. However, the "strength" of the component (i.e., the number of points it adds to the item) is considered the CL.

> [!example] 
> The character wants to enhance an axe. They have a handle that adds +3 dice to attack. The CL for enhancement will be 6.

As with item creation, the CL for enhancement can be influenced by tools, the workshop, and other circumstances (e.g., if the character is in a hurry).

#### Item Repair

If a character finds a damaged item or damages an item themselves, they have the option to repair it. The narrator determines whether the player can repair the item and what components are needed. It is important to note that items that have been [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Sacrifice\|sacrificed]] or deliberately destroyed cannot be repaired. A character can repair an item only if they have the relevant talent logically associated with repairing that item (such as a blacksmith). It is crucial to remember that once a player decides to repair their item, this action is irreversible. There is a risk that the player may damage the item further.

Item repair is carried out in the same way as creating a new item or enhancing an old one. The CL for repair is calculated the same way as when creating the item (i.e., the number of points and type determine the final CL - see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Items#Challenge Level for Creating an Item\|above]] under "Challenge Level for Creating an Item").

##### What is a Damaged Item?

A damaged item is one whose natural attributes are reduced due to improper use, heavy attack, or unfortunate accident. Despite the reduced attributes, such an item can still be used; however, only its reduced attributes are considered when rolling dice.

If an item's natural attributes are "exhausted," it is considered destroyed and can no longer be used. The weight of a damaged or destroyed item remains the same as for a regular item.
