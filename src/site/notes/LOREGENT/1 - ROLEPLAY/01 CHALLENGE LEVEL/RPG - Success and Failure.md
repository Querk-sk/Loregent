### Success and Failure

When a character rolls dice, all successes on their dice are counted. Then they are compared to the challenge level and evaluated. After rolling dice, the following cases may occur :

#### Complete Success

The character surpasses the challenge level and only successes appear on all their dice. For example, if the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] is 3 and the character rolled 6 successes out of 6 dice, it means the character will successfully accomplish the task exactly as they intended, and they may also receive a bonus from the narrator.

> [!example]
> - A character opens a chest without a key - they find rare metals or something important that makes the game easier for them.
> - A character doesn't open the chest without a key because they suddenly discover there's a bomb inside. The chest can be safely defused to prevent it from exploding somewhere. For example, it can blow up a wall or a door.

In case of full success, the narrator may decide to reduce the character's challenge level in the next roll, or give them an automatic success in the next roll.

- List of Complete Success (levels)
- 1 / 1 = no bonus    
- 2 / 2 = no bonus    
- 3 / 3 = -1 challenge level or +1 success    
- 4 / 4 = -1 challenge level or +1 success    
- 5 / 5 = -2 challenge level or +2 successes    
- 6 / 6 = -3 challenge level or +3 successes    
- 7 / 7 = -4 challenge level or +4 successes    
- 8 / 8 = -5 challenge level or +5 successes    
- more than 8 = -6 challenge level or +6 successes

#### Success

The character surpasses the challenge level. For example, if the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] is 3 and the character rolled 3 successes or more, then the character will successfully accomplish the task exactly as they intended. Or it might happen slightly differently, depending on the narrator. But it's always a success.

> [!example]
> - A character opens a chest without a key - they find gold or something important.
>  - A character doesn't open the chest without a key because they suddenly discover there's a bomb inside.

Alternatively, the character's challenge level for the next roll can be reduced by 1 upon success.

#### Story Failure

The character does not surpass the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]]. For example, if the challenge level is 3 and the character rolled 2 successes or less, then the character will not accomplish the task they wanted to do because they failed in their action. The character made a mistake, or something went wrong. The narrator will say exactly how the character failed and what happened.

> [!example]
> - The character opens the chest despite missing the challenge level, but the chest is empty.
> - Or they couldn't open the chest.
> - Or there was a bomb in the chest that exploded.

The level of story failure depends on how much the character missed the challenge level. The fewer successes the character has, the worse the outcome.

>[!example]
>The character tries to climb a wall at night, especially secretly so that no one sees them. The challenge level is 4.
>- 4 successes = Success, the character managed to climb the wall.
>- 3 successes = The character climbs up the wall, jumps through a window, and there is a guard.
>- 2 successes = The character slips, breaks a part of the wall, and it falls down. It can injure another character, or the stone can fall on the guards and they notice the character.
>- 1 success = The character falls from the wall. They must roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|dice]] to see if they can hold on or survive the fall.

#### Complete Failure

The character not only fails to surpass the challenge level, but also rolls no successes at all—only failures. In this case, not only does the character fail to accomplish the task they wanted to do, but something much worse happens.

> [!example]
> - The character opens the chest and a monster appears that they must defeat.
> - Or they make a noise and guards come
> - Or the bomb in the chest explodes and the floor collapses under the character.
> - The character falls from the wall and breaks their leg. Their fall and cry are heard by all the guards nearby.

In case of complete failure, the narrator may decide to increase the character's challenge level in the next roll, or the character automatically loses dice in the next roll.

- List of Complete Failure (levels)
- 1 / 1 = nothing    
- 2 / 2 = nothing    
- 3 / 3 = +1 challenge level or -1 die    
- 4 / 4 = +1 challenge level or -1 die    
- 5 / 5 = +2 challenge level or -2 dice    
- 6 / 6 = +3 challenge level or -3 dice    
- 7 / 7 = +4 challenge level or -4 dice    
- 8 / 8 = +5 challenge level or -5 dice    
- more than 8 = +6 challenge level or -6 dice

#### The Narrator Always Decides

What happens in case of success or failure is always decided by the narrator, who adjusts the story accordingly. A success doesn't always have to be a pure success (or gain), but it can also be opening a door behind which another path for the character might be waiting. Similarly, failure doesn't always have to be a "failure" (or loss), but it can be a new obstacle that leads the characters to the same goal, but through a different path than they intended. Everything depends solely on the story and the narrator.

#### Transfer of Successes

When characters perform the same action and one character fails their dice roll—meaning they don't surpass the challenge level while others do—those characters who surpassed the challenge level can help the one who didn't. They do this by transferring their successes. The number of successes that successful characters can transfer depends on the challenge level. They can only transfer successes that exceed the challenge level.

> [!example]
> A very dangerous enemy appears and the characters need to hide in a haystack.
> The characters roll their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|stealth]] skill against a challenge level of 3.
> 
> 1 character rolls 4 successes (surpassed [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] and could transfer 1 success)
> 2 character rolls 3 successes (surpassed [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] but can't transfer any success)
> 3 character rolls 2 successes (didn't surpass the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]], needs 1 success)
> 
> Character 1 helps Character 3 by transferring one of its successes. All characters successfully hide, even at the last moment.

Transferring successes can happen in all actions that characters perform together and simultaneously. Except in the case of attacking an enemy, which is considered fighting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances#Boj s viacerými nepriateľmi\|multiple enemies]].
