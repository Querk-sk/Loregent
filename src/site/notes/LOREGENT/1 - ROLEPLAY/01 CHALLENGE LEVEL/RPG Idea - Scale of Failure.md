#### Scale of Failure

Just make it so that the further you are from the target CL, the worse the failure gets. You could even use the same nomenclature as injuries (minor consequence, major consequences, so on...)

**You try to climb a castle's wall (CL 4)**
**4 Wins:** You do just that (Success)
**3 Wins:** You do that, but the guards say "welcome". Probably initiates combat (Narrative Failure)
**2 Wins:** You do that, but some rocks got loose in the process. Minor injury to one or more players (Narrative Failure)
**1 Wins:** The rope breaks. You either have another one, fix it, or find another way in (Literal Failure)
**0 Wins:** The rope breaks when you're already half way there, you fall off, break a leg, and the guards are alerted by your scream (Critical Failure)
