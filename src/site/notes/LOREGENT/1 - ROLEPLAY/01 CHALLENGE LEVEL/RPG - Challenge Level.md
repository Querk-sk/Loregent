### Challenge Level
(also referred to as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]])

When a character decides to do something in the story, the narrator assigns a so-called [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]]. The character must overcome this level for the activity to be successful. The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]] can be overcome by rolling dice.

> [!example]
> - The character escapes from prison and encounters a window with bars.
> - The player says they want to cut through the bars.
> - The narrator determines the difficulty level that must be overcome. Let's say they have a iron file, so the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] will be 3.
> - The player then rolls dice, and based on the result, the narrator decides whether the character managed to cut through the bars or not.

The challenge level is determined based on the difficulty of the activity the character is attempting. The more difficult the task, the higher the challenge level the character must overcome for the activity to be successful. If the narrator is unsure how to determine it precisely, they just need to imagine how an average person from that world would perform the task (or the narrator themselves, if they were in a similar situation). The narrator might think about assigning a higher or lower challenge level to a character with higher or lower attributes, but this should not be done. These things are resolved by dice and attribute points. The challenge level is determined in each game in the same way - as for an average person from that world.

> [!example]
> - The player's character and another random character are having a contest to see who can lift a large stone weighing 100 kg.
> - The player's character has a strength of 4 ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 4),
> - The other character is an average person with a strength of 0 ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 0).
> - Both have the same [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]], for example, 4. 
> - The winner will be decided by rolling dice.

The only thing that can change the challenge level is the circumstances in which the activity is performed.

> [!example]
> - The player's character ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2) wants to lift a car off the ground.
> - That's a challenge level of 4.
> - But it's in low gravity, say 3 times less than Earth's gravity.
> - This changes the challenge level to 2 because the circumstances are different.

This is a list of challenge levels and possible examples of what each number or level represents :

0. Easy activity (( Something that can be done very quickly and very easily ))
1. Common activity (( Something we do regularly, but it requires effort ))
2. Uncommon activity (( Something we do rarely, and it requires effort ))
3. Specialized activity (( This requires education ))
4. Hard activity (( This is really hard to do ))
5. Very hard activity (( This requires a lot of effort ))
6. Extremely hard activity (( Very few people can do this ))
7. Hardly imaginable activity (( This can't be done. Maybe in 1% of cases ))
8. Barely manageable activity (( This can't be done. Maybe in 0.5% of cases ))
9. Almost unachievable activity (( This is almost impossible to do ))
10. Unachievable activity (( This is really impossible to do ))

Another possible example of a challenge level :

1. Climb up normal stairs
2. Climb up slippery stairs (stairs have oil on their surface)
3. Climb up slippery stairs while holding a heavy chest
4. Climb up crumbling stairs (e.g., in an old tomb)"

#### Scalable Challenge Level

Sometimes in a story, it may not be possible to precisely determine the challenge of the activity the characters want to perform. In such cases, the narrator can ask the player to roll dice to determine their skill, and based on the result, the narrator will announce the outcome. A failure is considered when the player rolls no successes at all.

> [!example]
> The characters passed through a galactic gate to a completely unknown place. The narrator asked them to roll for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|perception]].
> 
> Character 1 rolled 3 successes.
> Character 2 rolled 1 success.
> Character 3 rolled 6 successes.
> Character 4 rolled 0 successes.
> 
> The narrator can say that Character 4's vision is still "unclean" and they are blinded after passing through the gate, so they see nothing. Characters 2 and 1 saw that they are in some room with old objects. Character 3 saw that they are in something resembling an old museum filled with artifacts, although the whole room looks terribly abandoned (because there is a lot of dust and cobwebs).
