### Other Challenge Levels

In this section, there are lists of challenge levels for variables such as distance, height, depth, weight, time, and so on. These lists serve as a guide for the Narrator when they want to determine the challenge level of a journey (when characters are traveling somewhere), the challenge level of a spell (for instance, when a character wants to lift a car with their magic), or the challenge level when characters encounter some danger and need to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|solve the situation quickly]].

#### Narrative distance between two places

This challenge level is used when characters are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Traveling\|traveling]] somewhere, and the Narrator wants to determine how long they will travel or how many events they will experience along the way. It can also be used when they are in a hurry (for instance, when the villain wants to activate a superweapon, and the characters want to stop them) to see if they can make it in time, or when a character is sneaking past guards to see if they go unnoticed.

The narrative distance increases the base challenge level of the character, changes the challenge level for the enemy, or changes the number of rounds during which the enemy can roll dice (for example, the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill when searching for the character).

Below is a list written in kilometers, but it can also be used for other distance units. So, for example, when determining a spaceship jump, it won't be calculated in kilometers but in light-years. And when a character floats in a space station and pushes off with their legs (to travel a distance, for example, from the bridge to the laboratory), it will be calculated in meters, not kilometers.

As for skills, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] is used to overcome distances (if the character is on foot), or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - others/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (if they are driving a car), but other skills can also be used as determined by the Narrator (for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] when jumping in a space station or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] when swimming across a river).

##### List of distances

1. Distance 0,5 Km || (15 minutes )
2. Distance 1 Km ||  (30 minutes)
3. Distance 5 Km ||  (1 hours)
4. Distance 10 Km ||  (2 hours)
5. Distance 50 Km || (10 hours)
6. Distance 100 Km || (20 hours)
7. Distance 500 Km || (4 days)
8. Distance 1 000 Km || (8 days)
9. Distance 5 000 Km || (1,5 months)
10. Distance 10 000 Km || (~3 months)
11. Distance 20 000 Km ||  (~6 months)

>[!note]
>- The time written for distances is the time it takes for a person to cover that distance. According to the internet, the walking speed of a person is approximately 5 km per hour.

##### Distance, car and shoes

Objects or machines that accelerate or somehow facilitate movement, reduce the challenge level when covering distances. The exact amount by which they reduce the challenge is determined by the Narrator, as each machine has different movement capabilities.

>[!example]
>
> * Magic Boots of Speed ​​= (minus) 1 ZL
> * Bicycle = (minus) 2 ZL
> * Car = (minus) 3 ZL
> * Single-seat plane = (minus) 6 ZL

The challenge of covering distances is also influenced by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Size of the character\|size of the character]]

##### Distance, terrain, and circumstances

When it comes to distance (whether narrative or combat), the success of overcoming it is influenced by circumstances such as terrain complexity, gravity strength, or thin air.

>[!example] 
>- A strong snowstorm can add a CL +2.
>- A high mountain can add a CL +4

Movement circumstances (whether terrain or weather, and so on) can be applied at any time and as needed. Sometimes the circumstance is so strong that before the main roll, the character must also make a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|skill check]] of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill. For instance, when they are in deep water or flying in low gravity.

##### Change in Movement Speed

The final challenge level (derived from distance) can also change based on how fast the character is moving. For example, when a character is rushing to overtake someone (say, in a race), or when they are slowly sneaking through a garden to avoid guards.

Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Slower movement has the advantage of the character moving much more quietly, but on the other hand, it takes longer. The advantage is that the character's challenge level decreases (for example, when walking through dry leaves), while the disadvantage is that the guards will roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] multiple times in a row. This time disadvantage, however, breaks the rules. Because on one hand, it decreases the challenge level derived from the distance, which on the other hand "kind of" speeds up the character's movement through the terrain - since the challenge level also indicates how quickly the character moves through a given section (for example, at challenge 4 it is about 2 hours, or 4 rounds of rolling dice). So what should the Narrator do?

Well, when a character moves slower, the challenge level decreases when solving problems (i.e., when rolling skills). However, the time is extended. If a character, for example, reduces the challenge by 2 (by moving slowly), their time is extended by 2. So, for a distance of 3, they will have challenges with CL 1, but it will extend their time to 5 ( 10 hours, or 5 rounds of rolling dice ).

* Slowly
	- Description:
		- The character moves slowly, carefully, or quietly.        
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 2 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 2.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance increases by +2.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +2 extra dice rolls.

- Slower    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves slower, more carefully, or more quietly.
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 1 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 1 success, or the CL for the enemy increases by 1.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance increases by +1.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +1 extra dice roll.

- Normal    
	- No changes

- Faster    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves a bit faster, more recklessly, or noisier.
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 1 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 1 success, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 1.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance decreases by 1.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 1 fewer dice roll.

- Even faster    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves even faster, more recklessly, or noisier.     
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 2 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 2.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance decreases by 2.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 2 fewer dice rolls.

>[!example]
The character is sneaking down a corridor with guards. However, they are in a great hurry because the enemy will activate their superweapon in 3 rounds.
>
The character decides to go 'even faster.' Thanks to this, they will overtake the enemy, but on the other hand, the guards may detect the character sooner because, to detect them, they need to overcome a much lower challenge level in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|perception]] rolls.
>
(In this case, it can be that the character rolls [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] and rolls 4 successes. This becomes the challenge level for the guards. They will roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] – but because the character is in a hurry, they only need to overcome CL 2 instead of CL 4.)

#### Narrative Height

Narrative height refers to the height that a character must overcome when jumping somewhere. Narrative height also includes depth when a character is falling from some height. It can also refer to the depth of the sea when a character is swimming in an underwater cave. It can also refer to flight altitude when a character is flying in an airplane. We have summarized all these cases in the following lists, assigning a challenge level to each height (or depth). The lists use challenge levels that have already been adjusted to account for normal human abilities.

However, if a height in the story is not a whole number (e.g., 4.2 m), the number is rounded "up" to determine the challenge level (in the case of 4.2 m, it will be 5 m).

##### Narrative Height

This list of challenges accounts for **jumping up** (when a character jumps somewhere), **jumping down** (when a character jumps into a pit), or even **leaping over** (when a character jumps across a chasm).

1. Height 2 m
2. Height 4 m
3. Height 8 m
4. Height 16 m
5. Height 32 m
6. Height 64 m
7. Height 128 m
8. Height 256 m
9. Height 512 m

##### Narrative Height (flying an airplane)

If a character is flying an airplane (and so on), they need to fly at a certain height above the ground to avoid crashing into a tower or tree. Therefore, the lower they fly (for instance, to avoid radar), the more challenging it will be for them to maneuver without crashing. The list below assumes a character flying a typical light airplane. Therefore, if the character in the story is flying something heavier, the Narrator should adjust this scale accordingly. The heavier the airplane, the higher the challenge at lower altitudes.

1. Height 512 m
2. Height 256 m
3. Height 128 m
4. Height 64 m
5. Height 32 m
6. Height 16 m
7. Height 8 m
8. Height 4 m
9. Height 2 m
10. Height 1 m
11. Height approximately 0 m

##### Narrative Depth

When a character swims in the sea, they swim at a certain depth. The deeper they dive, the more difficult swimming becomes due to increased water pressure and currents that are not present at shallower depths. The scale below reflects this challenge, accounting for a typical character swimming with regular diving equipment. However, if a character is swimming in a submarine (or something that protects them from pressure), like with distances, the machine subtracts some value from the challenge (for example, a personal submarine CL - 8).

1. Depth 2 m
2. Depth 4 m
3. Depth 8 m
4. Depth 16 m
5. Depth 32 m
6. Depth 64 m
7. Depth 128 m
8. Depth 256 m
9. Depth 512 m

#### Narrative Weight

It is used when characters want to lift something or someone, move something, push something. Simply put, they have to exert effort against some weight. Narrative weight has nothing to do with the character's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Inventory\|inventory]] (and the items in it).

Secondly, the challenge of narrative weight is relative. It will be determined differently, for example, in a world full of giants or in an ant world. Therefore, the Narrator must adjust this list (below) according to the story. The lists use challenge levels that have already been adjusted to account for normal human abilities.

0. wt. 5 Kg. (e.g., newborn, vacuum cleaner, watermelon)
1. wt. 10 Kg. (e.g., child, bucket of paint, tire)
2. wt. 20 Kg. (e.g., large bucket of paint, leopard, dumbbells)
3. wt. 40 Kg. (e.g., toilet, washing machine)
4. wt. 80 Kg. (e.g., baby elephant, bags of cement)
5. wt. 160 Kg. (e.g., refrigerator, large piano)
6. wt. 320 Kg. (e.g., deer, compressor, trailer)
7. wt. 640 Kg. (e.g., seven refrigerators, camel)
8. wt. 1 t. (e.g., car, minibus, medium-sized boat)
9. wt. 3 t. (e.g., rhinoceros, small truck, jeep)
10. wt. 5 t. (e.g., tank)
11. wt. 10 t
12. wt. 20 t
13. wt. 41 t
14. wt. 82 t
15. wt. 164 t
16. wt. 328 t
17. wt. 655 t
18. wt. 1 K.t
19. wt. 3 K.t
20. wt. 5 K.t

[Weight of Stuff – We like to weigh stuff so you don't have to](https://weightofstuff.com/)

- ton = 1000 kg
- kilo ton = 1000 t    
- mega ton = 1 million t    
- giga ton = 1 billion t

The challenge level from weight is reduced by objects or machines designed for lifting. The exact reduction must be determined by the Narrator, as each machine has different capabilities. (The list below includes machines or objects that operate in kilograms).

* Magic strength gloves = (minus) 1 CL
* Furniture moving straps = (minus) 2 CL
* Forklift = (minus) 7 CL
* Small crane = (minus) 10 CL

#### Timing of skills

It is used in the story when characters want to lift something and hold it for a certain time (for example, a burning coal, which is part of a courage ritual), or used for spells, for example when a character summons an elemental with a short lifespan.

##### Challenge level and time

0. Minute
1. 30 minutes
2. Hour
3. 12 hours
4. Day
5. 4 days
6. Week
7. 2 weeks
8. Month
9. 3 months
10. Half a year
11. Year
12. Two years
13. Five years
14. Ten years
15. Twenty years
16. etc.

##### CL, Time, and Speeding Up or Slowing Down

When a character needs to, they can speed up their action (e.g., disarming a bomb when there's no time, so they must hurry). Or when doing something complicated and wanting to concentrate - they can "slow down" their action. It's the same rule as with distances and movement speed, just slightly adjusted. Mainly in that for the required time to perform an action, the challenge list from the time is used (as shown above).

- Slowly    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action slowly, carefully, or quietly.   
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 2 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 2.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action increases by +2 (e.g., instead of 1 hour, it will take 1 day).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +2 extra dice rolls.

- Slower    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action slower, more carefully, or more quietly.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 1 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 1.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action increases by +1 (e.g., instead of 1 hour, it will take a few hours).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +1 extra dice roll.

- Normal    
    - No changes

- Faster    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action a bit faster, more recklessly, or noisier.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 1 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 1 success, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 1.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action decreases by 1 (e.g., instead of 1 day, it will take a few hours).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 1 fewer dice roll.

- Even Faster    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action even faster, more recklessly, or noisier.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 2 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 2.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action decreases by 2 (e.g., instead of 1 day, it will take an hour).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 2 fewer dice rolls.
