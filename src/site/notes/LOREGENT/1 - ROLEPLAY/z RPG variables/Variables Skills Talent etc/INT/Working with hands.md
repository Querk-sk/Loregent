#### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] focuses on everyday life skills and overall survival. This includes preparing food (e.g., if a character wants to bake a cake), repairing clothes (e.g., if a character wants to sew a shirt), and treating injuries or providing overall medical care.

For more complex tasks or those requiring formal education, this skill must be combined with a talent. Otherwise, the character rolls with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

##### All Verbs

Survival: 
Healing wounds, Treating illnesses, Providing first aid, Starting a fire, Setting up a tent, Using common survival skills in the wild

Domestic skills: 
Cooking, Baking, Sewing, Cleaning, Ironing

##### Healing, Crafting, Repairing, Survival:

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] is used for treating simple wounds (for deeper wounds, a character needs a talent).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] is used for cooking, baking, sewing, and other household chores. Therefore, it can also be used for creating items that require only knowledge and skilled hands but not complex machines. For example, brewing potions, embroidering magical runes into fabric, creating a statue (which a wizard might later bring to life), stringing beads (making a magical necklace), and so on.

##### Crafting or Repairing:

What if a blacksmith wants to forge a sword? If it's a regular blacksmith making a regular sword, they can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] If the blacksmith uses machines (like a computer-controlled lathe or something similarly complex), they use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]], because it's the machine (and not the blacksmith) making the sword.

##### Combinations with Talents

> [!example]
> * Cook - Prepares a complex dish.
> * Painter - Paints a complex picture.
> * Herbalist - for brewing potions, grinding herbs, drying, or other preparations (these preparations are similar to those in a regular kitchen).
> * Doctor - Cleans and stitches deep wounds. They know how to do it because they learned it.
