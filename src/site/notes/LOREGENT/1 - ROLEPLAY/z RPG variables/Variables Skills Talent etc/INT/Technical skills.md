#### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]

"[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]" focus on working with mechanical machines, computers, or complex mechanisms (like watches or locks). With this skill, a character can operate, repair, or build a machine (or create something using the machine).

Of course, this applies if the task is simple, common, or something that a regular "technically skilled" person in that world could do. For more complex tasks (like hacking a PC, replacing car electronics, building a washing machine), this skill must be combined with a talent. Otherwise, the character rolls with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

##### All Verbs

Machine or mechanism: 
Build, Create, Repair, Improve, Enlarge, Reduce, Open, Close, Weaken, Break, Explode, Worsen, Replace components

Operating a machine: 
Set up, Program, Use software

Other: 
Build a watch, Repair a computer, Create spreadsheets on a computer (or edit videos), Repair a car, Hack into another computer network (by overcoming protection)

##### Construction or Repair:

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] are used when dealing with a machine. If a character wants to build, improve, repair, program, or operate a machine, they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]. If they want to create an item using a machine, they also roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]].

For example, if a blacksmith wants to make a sword using a machine, like a computer-controlled lathe or something similarly complex, they roll "Technical skills." If they use their hands to make the sword, they roll "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" (though in this case, "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" could also apply).

##### Combinations with Talents

> [!example]
> * Hacker - Uses a computer to obtain secret (locked) information or to disable a device connected to the internet.
> * Archemist - Uses electrophoresis to extract magical essence from a plant.
> * Blacksmith - Programs a machine to make a sword or armor.
> * Auto Mechanic - Replacing car electronics, repairing the engine, programming fuel injection.
