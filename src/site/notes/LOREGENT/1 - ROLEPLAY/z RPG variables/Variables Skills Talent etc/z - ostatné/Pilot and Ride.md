#### Pilot and Ride

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] is a talent that brings the knowledge of controlling a self-moving vehicle. It is used for its control, piloting, and steering.

When a player allocates points to the talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]], they must choose which type of vehicle the talent applies to.
