##### Active Conflict

It is an action against a character who is aware of the conflict. This could be, for example, arm-wrestling, competition, running away, negotiating with a merchant about the price, and so on. When characters roll dice and get the same number of successes, they must roll again.

> [!example]
> The characters are arm-wrestling in the tavern. The skill involved is [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]].
> - Character 1 rolled 3 successes
> - Character 2 rolled 3 successes
> - They roll again until someone wins the roll.
