#### Success

The character surpasses the challenge level. For example, if the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] is 3 and the character rolled 3 successes or more, then the character will successfully accomplish the task exactly as they intended. Or it might happen slightly differently, depending on the narrator. But it's always a success.

> [!example]
> - A character opens a chest without a key - they find gold or something important.
>  - A character doesn't open the chest without a key because they suddenly discover there's a bomb inside.

Alternatively, the character's challenge level for the next roll can be reduced by 1 upon success.
