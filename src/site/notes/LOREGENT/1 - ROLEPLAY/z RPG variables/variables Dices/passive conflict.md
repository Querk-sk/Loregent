##### Passive Conflict

It is an action against a character who is completely unaware of the conflict. This could be, for example, lying, seducing, persuading, sneaking, and so on. When characters roll dice and get the same number of successes, the passive character (the victim) wins the conflict.

> [!example]
> Lying to a merchant
> - A character wants to deceive the merchant that their item is extremely rare.
> - Character 1 rolls 6 dice. 3 + 1 from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + 2 from the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]
> - The merchant rolls 6 dice. 3 + 0 from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + 3 from the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]
> - ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] is used as a defense against the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]], but any other skill from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] can be used)
><br>
> - Character 1 and the merchant roll dice
> - Character 1 rolled 4 successes
> - The merchant rolled 4 successes
> - The merchant wins the conflict.
><br>
> -  The merchant wins because he is just listening.
> - The character is active because they are thinking about how to deceive the merchant and therefore speaking.
> - The character must change the merchant's opinion. The merchant already has his opinion.
