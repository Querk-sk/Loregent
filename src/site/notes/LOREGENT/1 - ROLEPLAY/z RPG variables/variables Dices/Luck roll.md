#### INFO Luck roll

Luck changes the current situation either for the better or for the worse. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] refers to what is happening around the character at that moment. Therefore, it can only affect the "now," at the place where the character is standing, or for approximately one hour. A luck roll made by a character in the middle of the game cannot change the end of the game, nor can its result appear six months later.

A luck roll is used when:

1. The character wants to determine if they will have luck in finding something (They need gasoline - they go to an abandoned gas station and roll for luck to see if there is any).
2. The character wants to determine if the change that just occurred will worsen or improve their situation (It starts raining - will it be a heavy rain or just a drizzle? Will it be thick rain that reduces visibility for the enemy or the character?).
3. Something happens and the character needs to react quickly (This determines the complexity level for solving the problem, for example, how many rounds they have to disarm a bomb).
4. The character finds a shop. Whether it will have everything they need and at what price (for example, the shop could be very expensive or it might not have what they are looking for).
5. The character is under attack - the dice determine the enemy's strength (for example, whether the enemy will have strong weapon and armor).
6. The narrator wants to change the story (The characters will travel to another city for a week. The narrator rolls the dice - if it results in luck - the characters find a treasure map, if it results in misfortune - the characters are attacked by bandits).
