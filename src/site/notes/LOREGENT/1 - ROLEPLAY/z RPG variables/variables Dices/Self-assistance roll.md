### Self-assistance

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] cannot be used to assist another character; that's what [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Assistance\|Assistance]] is for. The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] roll  is used when the character wants to help themselves, or during [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Quick check\|quick skill check]], or as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Quick Reaction\|Quick Reaction]], or during combat when the character wants to use a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]] or an item.

The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] roll is made just like any other regular roll, but against the challenge level set by the narrator. The minimum level, however, is 3. The number of successes achieved in the self-assistance roll are reduced by the challenge level and then transferred as wins to the next roll (they are helping). It can happen that the number of wins from the self-assistance roll is lower than the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]] - in such a case, the wins are subtracted from the next roll.
