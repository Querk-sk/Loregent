#### INFO about Quick solution to the situation

During the story, there may be situations where a character must quickly react to danger that could cause injury (or death). In these situations, the narrator tells the players how to react and which skill they need to roll. The injury caused to the character is calculated against the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] of the situation.
