#### INFO Magic

This chapter contains basic information about magic, which you can use to create your own magical system. If you are looking for a magical system directly from our universe, you will find it in another book [[MAG - Full Book\|MAG - Full Book]]

>[!warning] Warning 
>The word '[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]]' or the word 'spell' in our RPG system is used as: 
>- A spell (fireball) 
>- Super abilities (laser eyes) 
>- Sci-fi technologies (hologram, teleport) 
>- Skills of skilled craftsmen (a cook and his spell 'my special pizza') 
>- Traits according to the type of character (a turtle that can spit out a stream of water) 
>- and other similar things.

A character can use magic for combat, defense, or to perform any other activity that comes from the given spell (e.g., a fireball to light a campfire).

Magic and spells work the same way as: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|skills]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|Combat]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|Weapons]]. So if you have read these chapters, you already know almost everything about magic.
