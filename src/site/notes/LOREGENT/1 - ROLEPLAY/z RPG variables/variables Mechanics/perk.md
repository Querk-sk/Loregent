#### INFO Perk

Some characters may have innate special traits (or talents or skills) that distinguish them from others. These traits are called 'perks.'

These innate advantages are given to players for free. However, their effect is limited to special cases. Some advantages may also have disadvantages. A player can choose only one innate advantage. However, this advantage (and any resulting possible disadvantage) is determined by the narrator.
