#### Disadvantage

When the narrator decides that fate is not in the character's favor, or the character has an unfavorable position. Or when the character lacks a talent and the situation requires that talent. Or when the character lacks specialization (or talent) for a weapon and the weapon requires specialization. Or when the character decides to restore 1 used [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. In this case, the win threshold may shift against the player. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1, 2, 3, or 4,** it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of Disadvantage)  
- If the die rolls a **5 or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of Disadvantage)

#### Great Disadvantage

It works the same way as disadvantage. It is used when a character lacks talent or specialization for magic and intends to use magic. Or when a character lacks a talent required for the situation, and the solution to the situation is very complex even for someone with education. Or when a character lacks specialization (or talent) for a weapon, and the weapon requires specialization, especially if it is a very complex weapon. Or when the character decides to restore 2 used [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. In this case, the win threshold may shift against the player. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1, 2, 3, 4, or 5,** it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of great Disadvantage)    
- If the die rolls a **6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of great Disadvantage)

#### Alternative Rule for Advantage and Disadvantage

- When a character rolls with an Advantage after rolling their dice, they re-roll only the dice that resulted in failure.    
- When a character rolls with a Disadvantage after rolling their dice, they must re-roll only the dice that resulted in success.    

The number of dice that can (or must) be re-rolled depends on the circumstances. In some situations, a character may have minor Advantage (or Disadvantage), in which case they re-roll one die. In other situations, where the Advantage (or Disadvantage) is significant, they re-roll three dice. The level of favor or disfavor can also be determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge]] of the task or the difference between the quality of equipment of the character and their opponent.

>[!example] For example: 
>- A character wants to treat another character's wounds. 
>- However, the wounds are too complex, so they need the "Doctor" talent.
>- Unfortunately, the character does not possess this talent, so they will roll with disfavor. 
>- The complexity level of the treatment is 4. 
>- Therefore, after their initial dice roll, they must re-roll 4 dice that resulted in success.
