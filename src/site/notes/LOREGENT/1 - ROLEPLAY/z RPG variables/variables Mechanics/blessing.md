#### INFO blessing

A blessing is a fundamental trait of a character that changes the entire game - interactions with the environment, items, and the world as a whole. Each blessing has its significant pros and cons. In the story, blessings are given by gods for service. A character can serve one or more gods (or none), and depending on how well the character serves the god, the blessing increases in strength (i.e., its influence on the character)."
