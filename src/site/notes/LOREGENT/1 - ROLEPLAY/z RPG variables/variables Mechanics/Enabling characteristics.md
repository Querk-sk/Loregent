#### INFO Enabling characteristics

Some characters may have an enhancement that gives them an advantage. This can be a health-related, psychological, or social advantage. Alternatively, a character may excel in something or be particularly successful in a specific area. In our RPG system, all of these aspects are represented by a mechanic called [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]].

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]] is a set of traits that give a character an advantage. They enhance them in some way or help them handle unique situations. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]] are given to characters to make them interesting. This mechanic, of course, also impacts game-play (by adding or subtracting points) and the story (by players portray their character according to their advantage, like actors in a film).

A player can take a maximum of **2 Enabling characteristics**, each of which must be approved by the narrator and may also be modified if necessary. If the story (and the narrator) permits, an enabling characteristic can also be removed over time.
