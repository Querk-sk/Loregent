#### INFO Enabling characteristics

Some characters may have enhancements that give them an advantage. These can be health-related, psychological, or social. Or a character might be good at something or simply benefit from certain things. All these mentioned aspects are expressed in our RPG system by a mechanic called 'advantage'.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]] are a set of traits that advantage the character. They improve them in some way or help them deal with situations the story (narrator) presents. Advantages are given to characters to make them more interesting. This mechanic also impacts the gameplay (adding or removing points), or the story (players act out their character according to their advantages, like actors in a film).

A player can take a maximum of 2 Advantages, each of which must be approved by the narrator and may be adjusted if necessary. If the story (and the narrator) allows, an advantage can be removed over time.
