#### INFO Disabling Characteristic

Every character has some sort of disadvantage. Each character has their difficulties, whether they are health-related, psychological, or social. Or a character might be bad at something or simply not good at certain things. All these mentioned difficulties are reflected in our RPG system by a mechanic called [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|Disabling Characteristic]].

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|Disabling Characteristic]] is a set of traits that disadvantage the character. They limit them in certain ways, causing problems in situations the story (narrator) presents. Disadvantages are given to characters to make them more interesting. This mechanic also impacts the gameplay (adding or removing points), or the story (players act out their character's disadvantage like actors in a film).
