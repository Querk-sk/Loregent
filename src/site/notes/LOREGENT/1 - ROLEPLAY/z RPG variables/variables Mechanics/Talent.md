#### INFO Talent

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is an aptitude for an activity that the character has (for example, being a skilled painter), or it is something the character has studied (for example, electrical engineering), or it is the character's profession (for example, a chef, programmer, healer) or it is the character's hobby (for example, an amateur detective). Talent can also be magic (for example, a school of fire, demon summoner, herbalist), a superpower (for example, Spiderman, laser eyes, mega strength), or a type of martial art (for example, boxer, samurai).

Talent therefore indicates what the character's main occupation is, what their role in the group is, or what they are really good at. In video games, the word talent could be used to denote a class (for example, ranger, necromancer), a type (for example, tank, support), or a role (for example, healer).
