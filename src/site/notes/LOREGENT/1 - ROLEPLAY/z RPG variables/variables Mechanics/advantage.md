#### Advantage

When the narrator decides that fate favors the character, or the character has a favorable position, or the character decides to use 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]. In this case, the win threshold shifts in favor of the character. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1 or 2**, it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of Advantage)    
- If the die rolls a **3, 4, 5, or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of Advantage)

#### Great Advantage

It works the same way as advantage. It is used when one character in a fight has equipment like from the Middle Ages and the other has equipment from the distant future, or when the character decides to use 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]. In this case, the win threshold shifts in favor of the character. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1**, it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of great Advantage)    
- If the die rolls a **2, 3, 4, 5, or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of great Advantage)
