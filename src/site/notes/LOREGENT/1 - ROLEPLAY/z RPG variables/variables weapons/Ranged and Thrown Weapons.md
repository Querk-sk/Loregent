##### Ranged and Thrown Weapons

These include bows, crossbows, pistols, shurikens, kunai, submachine guns, and all items that can shoot projectiles or be thrown.

Their advantage is that they are not limited by greater distances. Their effective range is from " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Normal Distance\|Normal]] " distance to " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Far\|far]] " (this of course depends on the type of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]]). If these ranged and thrown weapons are outside the range of hand-held weapons, the enemy (who owns a hand-held weapon) can only defend. In their defense, they cannot use their weapon. They can only use skills such as:

- " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] " (to dodge or perform a gymnastics maneuver),    
- or the skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] " (for running or performing an athletic maneuver),    
- or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] " (when they will actively defend with a shield or simply endure the injury).    

The disadvantage of ranged and thrown weapons is that the attacker must overcome a challenge level that depends on the weapon's complexity, the distance, and whether the target is in cover. If the attacker wins the combat roll but does not overcome the challenge, they cause no injury to the target (but the victory level remains, and they can choose another option).

Another disadvantage is that these weapons use ammunition. Hand-held thrown weapons such as knives, grenades, etc. have a specific number of uses. This means that the character has written in their inventory how many grenades they have. Once the character uses up these weapons, they lose them and must buy them again. As for firearms like submachine guns, pistols, etc., the exact number of bullets is not counted, but the number of shots after which the weapon must be reloaded. For example, a weapon can fire 6 times and then reload for 1 whole round.

A bow does not need to be reloaded because the character has a quiver of arrows, which takes up an extra inventory slot. Weapons that fire slowly, like crossbows, need to be reloaded. A crossbow can fire once and then must reload for 1 whole round.

###### Challenge Level for Hitting with Ranged and Thrown Weapons

Every ranged weapon is aimed in some way, and there is a difference between small weapons and large weapons. Therefore, every ranged weapon must have a so-called base Challenge level. This is the Challenge level that is later combined with the Challenge level of distance and the target's movement speed (according to the table below).

Base Challenge level:
- Small weapon = CL 1 (small weapons and throwing weapons)    
- Medium weapon = CL 2 (medium weapons and grenades)    
- Large weapon / difficult to handle = CL 3 (large weapons)    
- Very large weapon / very difficult to handle = CL 4 (huge weapons)

###### Challenge Table

| Distance / Target |              |            |     Static without cover      | Static 50% in cover | Static 90% in cover |
| :---------------: | :----------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: |
|       Melee       |    Close     |   0-1 m    | ranged weapons cannot be used |                     |                     |
|       Melee       |    Normal    |   2-3 m    |               0               |          1          |          2          |
|       Melee       |    Reach     |   4-5 m    |               0               |          1          |          2          |
|      Ranged       |    Furter    | 10 - 100 m |               1               |          2          |          3          |
|      Ranged       | Even Further | 200-500 m  |               2               |          3          |          1          |
|      Ranged       |     Far      | 600 - 1 km |               3               |          4          |          5          |
- A walking target is considered a static target.    
- Every speed above 50 km/h adds +1 CL (50 = 1, 100 = 2, 150 = 3, etc.)
