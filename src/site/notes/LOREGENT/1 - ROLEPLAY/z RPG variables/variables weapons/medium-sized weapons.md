###### Medium-sized Weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/medium-sized weapons\|medium-sized weapons]] for one hand or both hands, which can have a maximum length of 60 cm (roughly the length of an arm with a shoulder).

Regarding range:

- Medium melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Close Combat\|Close combat 0-1 m]]" (i.e., 0 - 1 m), "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Normal Distance\|Normal range]]" (2-3 m), or "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|within reach]]" combat (4-5 m).    
- At a distance of "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Further\|further]] 10 - 100 m," only **pacifist** combat options can be used.    
- At other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    
- Medium-sized ranged weapons **cannot** be used in "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Close Combat\|Close combat 0-1 m]]" (i.e., 0 - 1 m) or at a distance of "far (600 - 1 km)."    
- In "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Normal Distance\|Normal range]]" combat (2-3 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- In "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|within reach]]" combat (4-5 m) and at "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Further\|further]]" distance (10-100 m), they are used **without restrictions**.    

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 3 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

> [!note]
> Even though medium melee weapons can be used at a distance of 0 - 1 m or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|within reach]] (4 - 5 m), they do not gain any advantage during combat at this distance.
