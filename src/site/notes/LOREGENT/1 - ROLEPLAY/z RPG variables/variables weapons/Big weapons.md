### Weapons

Weapons are tools used primarily for attacking or defending against enemies. They can also be used for performing some [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] activities, such as cutting salami, chopping down a tree, or carving a wooden statue. Every [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] use of a weapon must be approved by the narrator.

#### Weapon Attributes

The main attribute of every weapon is attack. Attack increases the limit of maximum damage that the character can inflict on their enemy during combat. Weapons can have an attack at least at level 1 (meaning every weapon, including bare hands, causes at least 1 injury). This level of damage that a weapon can inflict can also be increased with specialization for that weapon.

> [!example]
> The character rolled their attack roll and achieved 4 wins.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 1, they will deal 1 damage to the enemy.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 3, they will deal 3 damage to the enemy.

If the weapon's attack (the limit of maximum damage) is higher than the number of dice the character can use for their attack roll, the character receives bonus dice for their roll. The number of bonus dice is equal to the difference between the weapon's attack and the character's attack.

> [!example]
> The character can use 6 dice for the attack (3 base + 2 from attributes + 1 specialization).
> The character owns a sword with attack 8.
> The sword's attack exceeds the character's attack by 2 (because 8 - 6 = 2).
> The character gets +2 dice for their attack roll.

Regarding the secondary use of the weapon for performing a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] activity, the number of attack points is converted into dice, which increases the number of dice when a skill is rolled. If the secondary use of the weapon leads to damaging the enemy, the attack points are not converted into dice and remain as the level of maximum damage.

The weapon can also have additional attributes or magical abilities. However, for the purpose of calculating the price (wealth points), these will be considered as an attack. As for weight (whether the weight of the weapon increases the attribute or not), the narrator can decide at their discretion.

The attributes of the weapon can help the character not only by adding dice or points to skills and the like but also by improving other properties of the weapon, such as reloading speed. However, these attributes increase the final price of the item while reducing the speed points.

Weapons can also have negative attributes that harm the character or somehow worsen the use of the weapon. Such attributes reduce the overall price of the item. As for speed points, the impact of bad attributes is determined by the narrator, but in most cases, they have no effect.

**List of Some Attributes** (there are certainly many, many more, but I have written these for now):
- All weapons without distinction = Maximum damage, skill dice   

**List of Some Special Properties** (there are certainly many, many more, but I have written these for now):

- **Storing/Exchanging Weapons (all weapons)**    
    - Determines how long it will take for the character to store their weapon in the inventory or how long it will take to exchange one weapon for another.        
    - The normal value is 1 round. Each acceleration increases the price by 2, while each deceleration decreases the price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.        
- **Complexity of Use (mostly ranged weapons)**    
    - Adds or increases the CL that the character must overcome to hit their target.        
    - Below in the text is written the CL that ranged weapons should have. Each increase in CL decreases the price by 3, while each decrease increases the price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.        
- **Magazine Size (only ranged weapons)**    
    - Determines the number of shots after which the character must reload the weapon.        
    - The normal value is 4 shots per reload. Each additional shot increases the final price by 3, while each missing shot decreases the price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.        
- **Reloading Duration (only ranged weapons)**    
    - Determines the number of rounds during which the character will reload the weapon.        
    - The normal value is considered 1 round for reloading. Anything faster or slower increases (or decreases) the final price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

#### Basic Division of Weapons

Weapons are divided into those that are "**melee**" – such as swords, axes, hammers, etc. And those that are "**ranged and thrown**" – such as shurikens, pistols, submachine guns, etc. Every weapon must be categorized into one of these categories.

However, what to do in cases where some weapons can be used both for melee and ranged? For example, an axe that a character can throw at an enemy, or a shuriken that can be used as a dagger? This alternative use of the weapon is rolled as a skill (for example, " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] " when the character wants to throw their axe accurately, or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] " if the axe is very heavy. Or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] " when the character wants to use the shuriken as a dagger). In this alternative use, the weapon's attributes are ignored, meaning they add exactly 0 dice. This does not apply if the character has a combat specialization in throwing that weapon. On the other hand, this alternative use of the weapon can cause injury.

And what about shields? Those hand-held ones that can be used together with a sword? All shields are considered blunt medium-sized weapons; therefore, they have all the advantages and disadvantages of medium blunt weapons. A character can use a shield separately, but also together with a medium sword or spear. When a character wants to fight with a sword and shield at the same time, they must have a special talent for it. Without it, they can only attack with one weapon per round.

##### Melee Weapons

Melee weapons include swords, small axes, maces, sticks, hand protectors (or bare hands), and even a wrench. These are all objects that a character can grasp in one or both hands and use to attack an enemy standing nearby (within a range of about 0 to 6 meters, depending on the weapon's size).

The advantage of these weapons is that they do not need to overcome a challenge level for a successful attack. Additionally, they allow for maneuvers to deflect the enemy's attack. Among hand weapons, there are basic types that do not require special talent to use but cause only minimal damage (such as sticks, poles, or tools like a wrench).

The disadvantage of these weapons is the limited range of combat distances. Their maximum distance is "within reach" (4-5 meters), and the minimum is "close combat" (0-1 meter). However, this also depends on the specific type of weapon.

> [!question] 
> What if a melee weapon has a spell that shoots at a distance? In that case, the attack with the spell is considered a ranged weapon attack, as if the character had a pistol.

##### Ranged and Thrown Weapons

These include bows, crossbows, pistols, shurikens, kunai, submachine guns, and all items that can shoot projectiles or be thrown.

Their advantage is that they are not limited by greater distances. Their effective range is from " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Common Distance\|common]] " distance to " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Far\|far]] " (this of course depends on the type of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]]). If these ranged and thrown weapons are outside the range of hand-held weapons, the enemy (who owns a hand-held weapon) can only defend. In their defense, they cannot use their weapon. They can only use skills such as:

- " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] " (to dodge or perform a gymnastics maneuver),    
- or the skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] " (for running or performing an athletic maneuver),    
- or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] " (when they will actively defend with a shield or simply endure the injury).    

The disadvantage of ranged and thrown weapons is that the attacker must overcome a difficulty level that depends on the weapon's complexity, the distance, and whether the target is in cover. If the attacker wins the combat roll but does not overcome the difficulty, they cause no injury to the target (but the victory level remains, and they can choose another option).

Another disadvantage is that these weapons use ammunition. Hand-held thrown weapons such as knives, grenades, etc. have a specific number of uses. This means that the character has written in their inventory how many grenades they have. Once the character uses up these weapons, they lose them and must buy them again. As for firearms like submachine guns, pistols, etc., the exact number of bullets is not counted, but the number of shots after which the weapon must be reloaded. For example, a weapon can fire 6 times and then reload for 1 whole round.

A bow does not need to be reloaded because the character has a quiver of arrows, which takes up an extra inventory slot. Weapons that fire slowly, like crossbows, need to be reloaded. A crossbow can fire once and then must reload for 1 whole round.

###### Challenge Level for Hitting with Ranged and Thrown Weapons

Every ranged weapon is aimed in some way, and there is a difference between small weapons and large weapons. Therefore, every ranged weapon must have a so-called base Challenge level. This is the Challenge level that is later combined with the Challenge level of distance and the target's movement speed (according to the table below).

Base Challenge level:
- Small weapon = CL 1 (small weapons and throwing weapons)    
- Medium weapon = CL 2 (medium weapons and grenades)    
- Large weapon / difficult to handle = CL 3 (large weapons)    
- Very large weapon / very difficult to handle = CL 4 (huge weapons)

###### Challenge Table

| Distance / Target |              |            |     Static without cover      | Static 50% in cover | Static 90% in cover |
| :---------------: | :----------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: |
|       Melee       |    Close     |   0-1 m    | ranged weapons cannot be used |                     |                     |
|       Melee       |    Normal    |   2-3 m    |               0               |          1          |          2          |
|       Melee       |    Reach     |   4-5 m    |               0               |          1          |          2          |
|      Ranged       |    Furter    | 10 - 100 m |               1               |          2          |          3          |
|      Ranged       | Even Further | 200-500 m  |               2               |          3          |          1          |
|      Ranged       |     Far      | 600 - 1 km |               3               |          4          |          5          |
- A walking target is considered a static target.    
- Every speed above 50 km/h adds +1 CL (50 = 1, 100 = 2, 150 = 3, etc.)

##### Type of Attack

Weapons are categorized by their type of attack to determine their effect on the enemy's armor. This classification also influences the narrative or secondary use of weapons.

###### Blunt Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through the force of impact, with the goal of breaking bones, causing concussions, and crushing the enemy. Examples include hammers, maces, nunchaku, various sticks, rods, pipe repair tools, as well as hands or hand protectors.

###### Sharp Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through the sharpness of the blade, with the goal of cutting, slashing, and severing. Examples include axes, knives, swords, and daggers.

###### Piercing Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through speed and thrusting force, with the goal of piercing the target. This category includes all ranged weapons (from bows and crossbows to pistols and submachine guns), as well as weapons designed for stabbing (such as spears, rapiers, etc.)

###### Explosive Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through the expansive force of gas, chemical, or explosive mixtures, with the goal of tearing the target to pieces. Examples include grenades, explosive ammunition, or weapons that generate high pressure or shock waves.

Explosive weapons must specify their area of effect. Whether it is an explosion within a range of "Close 0-1 m" or an explosion within a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance\|range]] of "Normal 2-3 m."

##### Weapon Size

###### Hand Protectors

These are weapons that are worn directly on the hands to serve as protectors. This category also includes bare hands, for example, when a character loses their main weapon or is trained in hand-to-hand combat (such as kung fu).

In terms of size, these weapons can be up to 5 cm. This means that an object protruding from the protector can be up to 5 cm. As for magic, spells that use touch are considered hand protectors (e.g., a spell like "poisonous touch" is considered a weapon "hand protectors").

- In terms of range, these weapons **can** injure the target only in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m),    
- In "normal range" (2-3 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used upon victory,    
- And at other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all, meaning they are not counted in the combat roll.    

As for fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 1 enemy (+1 for each point in specialization).

And regarding any special advantages, besides being able to enter [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Big weapons#Hand-to-Hand Combat\|hand-to-hand combat]], they can do so immediately after disarming the enemy. This means that in the next combat round, they start in the "close combat" position, with combat priority—as if the attacker had the highest [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].

###### Small Weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/small weapons\|small weapons]] for one hand, which can have a maximum length of 15 cm. That's roughly the size of a hand with fingers.

Regarding range:
- Small melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m) or "normal range" (2-3 m).    
- In "within reach" combat (4-5 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used upon victory.    
- In other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    
- Small ranged weapons **can** be used in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m), "normal range" (2-3 m), and "within reach" combat (4-5 m).    
- At "further" distance (10-100 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- At other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 2 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

As for any special advantages, these weapons can enter hand-to-hand combat.

###### Medium-sized Weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/medium-sized weapons\|medium-sized weapons]] for one hand or both hands, which can have a maximum length of 60 cm (roughly the length of an arm with a shoulder).

Regarding range:

- Medium melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m), "normal range" (2-3 m), or "within reach" combat (4-5 m).    
- At a distance of "further 10 - 100 m," only **pacifist** combat options can be used.    
- At other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    
- Medium-sized ranged weapons **cannot** be used in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m) or at a distance of "far (600 - 1 km)."    
- In "normal range" combat (2-3 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- In "within reach" combat (4-5 m) and at "further" distance (10-100 m), they are used **without restrictions**.    

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 3 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

> [!note]
> Even though medium melee weapons can be used at a distance of 0 - 1 m or within reach (4 - 5 m), they do not gain any advantage during combat at this distance.

###### Big weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Big weapons\|Big weapons]] for one or both hands, which can have a maximum length of 200 cm (slightly taller than a human).

Regarding range:

- Large melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "normal range" (2 - 3 m) and "within reach" (4 - 5 m).    
- At a distance of "further" (10 - 100 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used.    
- These weapons **cannot** be used at distances "close combat" (0 - 1 m), "even further" (200 - 500 m), and "far" (600 - 1 km).    
- Large ranged weapons **cannot** be used in "close combat" (0 - 1 m) or "normal range" (2 - 3 m).    
- In "within reach" combat (4 - 5 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- At other distances, they can be used **without restrictions** (i.e., 200 m -- 1 km).

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 4 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

As for any special advantages, these weapons can enter combat at a distance of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|within reach]], where they gain a bonus for “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Big weapons#Combat Within Reach\|within reach combat]]” (described below in the list of weapon modifiers).

#### Ammunition for Weapons

Ammunition can change certain attributes of the weapon, such as attack, but it can also change the way the weapon is used in combat—for example, by adding an element or making the attack effective against invulnerable enemies (e.g., vampires).

The weight of the ammunition is always 1 (for approximately 50 bullets or arrows). Physical statistics do not affect the weight of the ammunition. For larger quantities or larger sizes of ammunition, the narrator decides its weight. In most stories, basic ammunition is not counted (the player can shoot as much as they want). However, if the narrator wishes, special ammunition can be limited by number (e.g., to 50 attacks). The type and special properties of the ammunition serve only as a modifier for the weapon's combat attack.

- **Normal Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that are considered standard in the given story. Basic bullets and arrows that do not change the weapon's attributes (price 2/box)        
- **Enhanced Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that are considered very good in the given story. They increase the natural attack. They may also have special properties like bullets that penetrate armor or can pierce dragon skin (price 4/box)        
- **Special Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that do something extra or change the way the weapon is used. For example, explosive arrows, airsoft bullets with acid, incendiary bullets, freezing bullets (or anything from the Borderlands universe).        
    - The properties of the ammunition, as well as the size of the effect, are determined by the narrator. The effect should influence at least 0 - 1 m. The duration of the effect is also determined by the narrator. It should last at least 1 round.        
    - (price 8/box)        
- **Magical Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that perform some spell upon firing. They need to be activated before firing, consuming the character's energy. For example, fireball arrows or bullets that turn into clay hands and stick the target to the ground or wall.        
    - (arrows attack +2, special effect max +5 = number of victories / direct damage effect when the player wins the combat roll. The narrator can change the ammunition's attributes.)        
    - The properties of the ammunition, as well as the size of the effect, are determined by the narrator. The effect should influence at least 0 - 1 m. The duration of the effect is also determined by the narrator. It should last at least 1 round.

#### Weapon Modifiers / Circumstances

##### Unarmed Combat

When the character has no weapon, hand protectors, and no talent in unarmed combat (e.g., karate), they lose 2 dice from their combat roll.

##### Combat Without Weapon Talent

When the character has a weapon they have no talent or specialization for, they roll the combat roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the character is disarmed, only the "unarmed combat" modifier applies (meaning they lose only 2 dice even when disarmed).

##### Close combat

When the character fights at a distance of “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Close Combat\|Close Combat 0-1 m]]” and has the correct type of weapons (e.g., hand protectors or small melee weapons or small ranged weapons), the enemy's armor is completely ignored (as if the enemy had 0 armor).

Regarding hand protectors, they can immediately engage in close combat after disarming the enemy without needing another roll.

##### Combat Within Reach

When the character fights at a distance of “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|Within Reach 4-5 m]]” and has the correct type of weapons (e.g., large melee weapons or ranged or thrown weapons), half of their weapon's attack is reserved as victories (rounded down).

For example, if the character has a large axe with an attack of 4, 2 victories are reserved.

##### Weapon Cannot Be Used

When the character:
- attacks with a weapon at a distance where the weapon cannot be used,    
- or the weapon is broken (e.g., a submachine gun is jammed),    
- or circumstances do not allow the weapon to be used (e.g., a large weapon in a small tunnel), then the weapon is not counted in the combat roll.    

The narrator decides whether the character:
- will fight unarmed (see weapon modifier "unarmed combat"),    
- will fight with the weapon, but the weapon's attributes will not be counted (i.e., the weapon, talent, and specialization will contribute 0),    
- or will be able to use the weapon with attributes (like attack, talent, specialization), but the character will only be able to use deflecting attacks or pacifist victory options of a certain kind upon winning the roll.

##### Uneven Equipment

The character's and the enemy's equipment are at different technological levels. Suppose the character has medieval equipment (sword, cloth armor) and the enemy has modern equipment (bulletproof vest, submachine gun).

In such a case, the character with modern equipment will roll the dice with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|great advantage]].
