###### Small Weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/small weapons\|small weapons]] for one hand, which can have a maximum length of 15 cm. That's roughly the size of a hand with fingers.

Regarding range:
- Small melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m) or "normal range" (2-3 m).    
- In "within reach" combat (4-5 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used upon victory.    
- In other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    
- Small ranged weapons **can** be used in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m), "normal range" (2-3 m), and "within reach" combat (4-5 m).    
- At "further" distance (10-100 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- At other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 2 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

As for any special advantages, these weapons can enter hand-to-hand combat.
