###### Hand Protectors

These are weapons that are worn directly on the hands to serve as protectors. This category also includes bare hands, for example, when a character loses their main weapon or is trained in hand-to-hand combat (such as kung fu).

In terms of size, these weapons can be up to 5 cm. This means that an object protruding from the protector can be up to 5 cm. As for magic, spells that use touch are considered hand protectors (e.g., a spell like "poisonous touch" is considered a weapon "hand protectors").

- In terms of range, these weapons **can** injure the target only in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m),    
- In "normal range" (2-3 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used upon victory,    
- And at other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all, meaning they are not counted in the combat roll.    

As for fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 1 enemy (+1 for each point in specialization).

And regarding any special advantages, besides being able to enter [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Hand protectors#Hand-to-Hand Combat\|hand-to-hand combat]], they can do so immediately after disarming the enemy. This means that in the next combat round, they start in the "close combat" position, with combat priorityâ€”as if the attacker had the highest [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].
