#### Info - Shields

All [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Shields\|shields]] are considered blunt medium-sized weapons; therefore, they have all the advantages and disadvantages of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Medium-sized Weapons\|medium]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Blunt weapons\|blunt weapons]]. A character can use a shield separately, but also together with a medium sword or spear. When a character wants to fight with a sword and shield at the same time, they must have a special talent for it. Without it, they can only attack with one weapon per round. Shields can be also used in maneuver called as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers#Damage Absorption - f\|damage absorption]].

###### Medium-sized Weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/medium-sized weapons\|medium-sized weapons]] for one hand or both hands, which can have a maximum length of 60 cm (roughly the length of an arm with a shoulder).

Regarding range:

- Medium melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Close Combat\|Close combat 0-1 m]]" (i.e., 0 - 1 m), "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Normal Distance\|Normal range]]" (2-3 m), or "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|within reach]]" combat (4-5 m).    
- At a distance of "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Further\|further]] 10 - 100 m," only **pacifist** combat options can be used.    
- At other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    
- Medium-sized ranged weapons **cannot** be used in "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Close Combat\|Close combat 0-1 m]]" (i.e., 0 - 1 m) or at a distance of "far (600 - 1 km)."    
- In "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Normal Distance\|Normal range]]" combat (2-3 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- In "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|within reach]]" combat (4-5 m) and at "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Further\|further]]" distance (10-100 m), they are used **without restrictions**.    

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 3 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

> [!note]
> Even though medium melee weapons can be used at a distance of 0 - 1 m or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|within reach]] (4 - 5 m), they do not gain any advantage during combat at this distance.

###### Damage Absorption - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action used instead of an attack - fast action.

**Description:** Damage absorption serves to reduce the damage that the character would receive. It is rolled as the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] skill, without the use of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] or items (which can only be used for sacrifice). Shield can be used in this roll - the number of attributes in shield is converted into dice, which increases the number of dice in the damage absorption roll.

The roll is made against the enemy's attack. The number of wins the character rolls is the amount by which their damage is reduced. The result of this roll is final, and the damage cannot be reduced further by armor.

Damage absorption serves to absorb the enemy's attack without causing any injury to the enemy. The character does not gain any benefits from a successful damage absorption.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per combat round.

**Specialization:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] are not used for this maneuver.
