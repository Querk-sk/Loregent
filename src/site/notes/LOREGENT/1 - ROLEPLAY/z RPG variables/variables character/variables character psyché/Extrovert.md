#### Extrovert (spoločenskosť)

This is a person who hates being alone. They always need someone around to talk to. They don’t like when people sit quietly next to each other without conversing. They enjoy working with people, know how to interact with them (like giving advice or managing their anger), and enjoy doing so. In extreme cases, they are constantly seeking out company because when they are alone, they get scared or depressed.
