#### Paranoia (character psych√©)

This person is hard to convince and always needs some proof. When walking down a quiet alley, they expect an attack. In extreme cases, this person trusts virtually nothing and no one (regardless of evidence). They need multiple reassurances that nothing is happening and that no one wants to deceive them.
