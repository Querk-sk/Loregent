#### Workaholism (character psych√©)

This person loves work. To the extent that they can immerse themselves in it for long hours, regardless of their personal life, the needs of others, and circumstances. The work must be done (this doesn't mean it has to be completed immediately). In extreme cases, they do not stop working.
