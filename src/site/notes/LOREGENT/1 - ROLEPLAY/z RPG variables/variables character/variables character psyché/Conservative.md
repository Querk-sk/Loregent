#### Conservative (character psyché)

This type of person hates new things, is afraid of adrenaline activities, and dislikes risk. They are happy when nothing changes and everything stays as it was. They don’t like new things; for example, they can wear clothes until they fall apart. In extreme cases, it’s even worse—they avoid anything that looks even a bit new (new game?) or adrenaline-inducing. They cling only to what they know and let nothing new into their life.
