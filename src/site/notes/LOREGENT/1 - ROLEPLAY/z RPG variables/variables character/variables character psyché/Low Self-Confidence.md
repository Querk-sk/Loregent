#### Low Self-Confidence (character psych√©)

This person doesn't believe in themselves. And even if they had three physics diplomas, they would question everything they say unless they really fact-checked it. In extreme cases, this fact-checking is so frequent it borders on OCD (like checking 300 times if they turned off the gas on the stove).
