#### Stimuli (character psyché)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Excitable\|Excitable]] (6, 5) = This person needs excitement in their life. Something must always be happening, and if it’s not, they will make it happen. They love risk, gambling, and adrenaline activities. They enjoy trying new things. In extreme cases, adrenaline is like a drug for this person.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Moderately Excitable\|Moderately Excitable]] (4, 3) = This person needs a small amount of excitement in their life. They know when to stop, when to take risks, and they also know how to relax. They don’t mind boredom.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Conservative\|Conservative]] (2, 1) = This type of person hates new things, is afraid of adrenaline activities, and dislikes risk. They are happy when nothing changes and everything stays as it was. They don’t like new things; for example, they can wear clothes until they fall apart. In extreme cases, it’s even worse—they avoid anything that looks even a bit new (new game?) or adrenaline-inducing. They cling only to what they know and let nothing new into their life.
