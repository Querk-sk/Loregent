#### Stoic (character psych√©)

As for emotions, this person is not easily shaken. They can perfectly control their reactions to events and there is practically no one who can make them angry. On the other hand, they demand perfect control from others as well. They cannot empathize with others' feelings, or they generally dislike emotions. In extreme cases, they are like a walking logical stone.
