#### Personality Orientation (character psyché)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Orbicentric\|Orbicentric]] (6, 5) = This person focuses on the external world and not on themselves (meaning they hardly acknowledge their own needs) and sacrifices for others. Others must be helped—they do not need help themselves. In extreme cases, they prioritize the whole world over their needs.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Centric\|Centric]] (4, 3) = This person is aware of their needs and also the needs of others. They help people based on the context (e.g., in terms of health), whether they can help themselves (because people can exploit kindness), and whether it won’t harm them (e.g., losing all their money).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Egocentric\|Egocentric]] (2, 1) = This person sees only their needs and the needs of others as if they don't exist. To help others, someone must force them or reward them greatly. In extreme cases, they think only of themselves and their needs
