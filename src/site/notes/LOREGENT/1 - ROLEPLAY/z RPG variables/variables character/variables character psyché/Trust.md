#### Trust (character psyché)

This person knows there are bad people, but believes there is good in every bad person—it just needs to be brought out. Maybe it’s all about the approach. No one is bad; maybe they just had a bad day. And if walking down a quiet alley, even in a dangerous part of town, they will behave as usual, believing they are not in danger. In extreme cases (2b), this person does not believe there are bad people or bad places. They essentially don't check people out. If they are walking down a quiet alley in the most dangerous part of town, they will be singing, believing nothing can harm them.
