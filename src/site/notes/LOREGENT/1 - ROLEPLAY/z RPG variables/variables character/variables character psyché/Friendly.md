#### Friendly (character psyché)

This type of person (relatively) quickly makes friends and tries to get along well with everyone. If they are in a foreign environment, they want to meet and befriend everyone—because everyone should be a friend, right? And if not, they feel sad. In extreme cases, they talk to everyone and immediately offer their friendship (and maybe even gifts).
