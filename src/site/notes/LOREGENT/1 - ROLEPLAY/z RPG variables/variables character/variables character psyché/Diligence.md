#### Diligence (character psyché)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Workaholism\|Workaholism]] (6, 5) = This person loves work. To the extent that they can immerse themselves in it for long hours, regardless of their personal life, the needs of others, and circumstances. The work must be done (this doesn't mean it has to be completed immediately). In extreme cases, they do not stop working.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Average hard worker\|Average hard worker]] (4, 3) = As for work, this person knows when something needs to be done, it needs to be done. On the other hand, they don’t overdo it with work and will pause when tired or when other circumstances arise (and possibly rest).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Laziness\|Laziness]] (2, 1) = This person hates work. They would prefer to rest all day and delay everything indefinitely. They do things at the last minute, after multiple prompts. However, they do focus on others (e.g., their personal life flourishes, just don't expect anything immediately from them). In extreme cases, this person rarely does or completes anything.
