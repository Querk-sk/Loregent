#### Initiative (character psyché)

This person solves problems as soon as they arise and as quickly as possible. They don’t postpone anything until tomorrow, and if the situation requires something to be done, they do it. They hate when someone procrastinates. In extreme cases, this character is hyperactive and, when nothing is happening, they invent something to solve.
