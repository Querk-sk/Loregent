#### Laziness (character psych√©)

This person hates work. They would prefer to rest all day and delay everything indefinitely. They do things at the last minute, after multiple prompts. However, they do focus on others (e.g., their personal life flourishes, just don't expect anything immediately from them). In extreme cases, this person rarely does or completes anything.
