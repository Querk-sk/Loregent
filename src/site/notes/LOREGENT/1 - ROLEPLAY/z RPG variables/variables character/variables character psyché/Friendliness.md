#### Friendliness (character psyché)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Friendly\|Friendly]] (6, 5) = This type of person (relatively) quickly makes friends and tries to get along well with everyone. If they are in a foreign environment, they want to meet and befriend everyone—because everyone should be a friend, right? And if not, they feel sad. In extreme cases, they talk to everyone and immediately offer their friendship (and maybe even gifts).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Assertive\|Assertive]] (4, 3) = This type of person approaches friendship neutrally. They don't force friendships or enmities and interact with people in a 'regular' way. Because not everyone can be a friend, and not everyone is immediately an enemy.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Unfriendly\|Unfriendly]] (2, 1) = This person doesn't need or want friends. They either manage on their own, isolate themselves from others, or deal with everyone formally. They don’t necessarily want to harm others, but for some, it's not out of the question. On the other hand, a lack of friends may be due to aggression or an inability to interact with people—they may be socially awkward or shy. In extreme cases, it appears the character suffers from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Disabling Characteristic#Item 4 - Sociopathy\|sociopathy]].
