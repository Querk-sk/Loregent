#### Facts (character psyché)

This person is characterized by strict thinking. They can recall factual things that other people cannot. They live mainly in the real world rather than in fantasy. They hate working with imagination. Everything must be supported by solid data—no beliefs, no magic—everything must make sense. In extreme cases, they hate everything that even hints at fantasy. They simply don't believe it or they despise it.
