#### Sociability

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Introvert\|Introvert]] (6, 5) = This is a person who prefers to be alone or deals with a smaller number of people. Being in the company of strangers or large groups of people exhausts them. An introvert focuses on working with computers, books, or other inanimate objects. They dislike working with people (like doctors or salespeople). In extreme cases, they would prefer to be on a deserted island because other people literally drain the life out of them. They prefer interacting with their friends, family, or people they like and know well.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Ambivert\|Ambivert]] (4, 3) = This is a person who doesn’t mind solitude or company, as long as it’s not extreme or for too long. For example, they couldn't handle a deserted island, but also wouldn't enjoy a crowded disco. This person can tolerate people and work with them (as long as it’s not for too long, like meeting new people all week during lectures where they're the center of attention). They enjoy making new contacts but prefer turning them into long-term friends.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Extrovert\|Extrovert]] (2, 1) = This is a person who hates being alone. They always need someone around to talk to. They don’t like when people sit quietly next to each other without conversing. They enjoy working with people, know how to interact with them (like giving advice or managing their anger), and enjoy doing so. In extreme cases, they are constantly seeking out company because when they are alone, they get scared or depressed.
