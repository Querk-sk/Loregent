#### Introvert (spoločenskosť)

This is a person who prefers to be alone or deals with a smaller number of people. Being in the company of strangers or large groups of people exhausts them. An introvert focuses on working with computers, books, or other inanimate objects. They dislike working with people (like doctors or salespeople). In extreme cases, they would prefer to be on a deserted island because other people literally drain the life out of them. They prefer interacting with their friends, family, or people they like and know well.
