#### Podnikavosť (psychika postáv)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Initiative\|Initiative]] (6, 5) = This person solves problems as soon as they arise and as quickly as possible. They don’t postpone anything until tomorrow, and if the situation requires something to be done, they do it. They hate when someone procrastinates. In extreme cases (-2b), this character is hyperactive and, when nothing is happening, they invent something to solve.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Mixed\|Mixed]] (4, 3) = This person solves problems, but not necessarily immediately. If something can be postponed, it waits a bit.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Passivity\|Passivity]] (2, 1) = This person postpones things. It’s best if problems resolve themselves. They don't like being pushed into solving problems, believing there’s always time. In extreme cases (2b), this character won’t lift a finger, even after multiple urgings.
