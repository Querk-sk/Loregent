#### Pessimism (character psych√©)

This person perceives the world as worse than it actually is and mainly experiences negative emotions. They see the glass as half-empty and focus on the empty part. In extreme cases, they are like a total dark cloud, able to be unhappy (and see bad things) even in completely positive situations or celebrations.
