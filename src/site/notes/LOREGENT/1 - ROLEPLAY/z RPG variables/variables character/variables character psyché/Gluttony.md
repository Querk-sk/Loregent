#### Gluttony (character psych√©)

This person wants everything immediately. If you place a kilogram of chocolate in front of them, they will literally eat it all. When there is something they want to buy, they do so almost immediately. (Their gluttony depends on their moral compass). In extreme cases, this person really cannot control themselves.
