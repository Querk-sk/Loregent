#### Unfriendly (character psyché)

This person doesn't need or want friends. They either manage on their own, isolate themselves from others, or deal with everyone formally. They don’t necessarily want to harm others, but for some, it's not out of the question. On the other hand, a lack of friends may be due to aggression or an inability to interact with people—they may be socially awkward or shy. In extreme cases, it appears the character suffers from sociopathy.
