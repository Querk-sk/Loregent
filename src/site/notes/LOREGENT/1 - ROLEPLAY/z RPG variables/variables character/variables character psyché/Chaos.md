#### Chaos (character psyché)

This type of person can tolerate disorder. The fact that things are not in their place does not bother them at all (and honestly, they kind of like it because order is boring). It seems they navigate best in chaos—where things don’t necessarily have a head or tail. In extreme cases, they are the king of disorder and chaos, having mess everywhere. (But they know their way around it, at least in 60% of cases). However, their improvisation skills are really strong.
