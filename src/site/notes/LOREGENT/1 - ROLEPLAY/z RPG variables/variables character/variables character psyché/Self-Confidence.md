#### Sebadôvera (character psyché)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/High Self-Confidence\|High Self-Confidence]] (6, 5) = This person believes in themselves. They know they are always right, and they know they can do and solve everything. In extreme cases, this self-confidence is so extreme it becomes arrogance (I am infallible, why are you blaming me?).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Average Self-Confidence\|Average Self-Confidence]] (4, 3) = This person knows their limits. They know what they can and cannot do.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Low Self-Confidence\|Low Self-Confidence]] (2, 1) = This person doesn't believe in themselves. And even if they had three physics diplomas, they would question everything they say unless they really fact-checked it. In extreme cases, this fact-checking is so frequent it borders on OCD (like checking 300 times if they turned off the gas on the stove).
