#### Rule-Following (character psyché)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Flexible\|Flexible]] (6, 5) = This is a person who knows how to bend the rules for their benefit—those they don’t like, they either ignore or interpret to suit themselves. In extreme cases, rules don’t exist for this person.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]] (4, 3) = This person follows rules as long as they make sense. If something is nonsensical (or against their moral principles), they ignore it.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Rigid\|Rigid]] (2, 1) = This person follows rules to the letter. Whether they make sense or not, they were written for a reason and, most importantly, to be followed. In extreme cases, nothing but rules exist—and they must be followed to the letter of the law.
