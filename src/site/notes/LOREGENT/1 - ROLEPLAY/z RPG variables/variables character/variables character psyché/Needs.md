#### Needs (character psyché)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Self-Control\|Self-Control]] (6, 5) = This person can delay gratification and tolerate long periods of frustration, believing that their patience will be generously rewarded. In extreme cases, they refuse pleasure and take joy in denying themselves something.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Sustainable\|Sustainable]] (4, 3) = This person can give up pleasure, but only for a short time. If frustration lasts too long, they lose control (although this depends on their moral compass).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Gluttony\|Gluttony]] (2, 1) = This person wants everything immediately. If you place a kilogram of chocolate in front of them, they will literally eat it all. When there is something they want to buy, they do so almost immediately. (Their gluttony depends on their moral compass). In extreme cases, this person really cannot control themselves.
