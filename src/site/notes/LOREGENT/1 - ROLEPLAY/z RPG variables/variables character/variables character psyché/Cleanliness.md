#### Cleanliness (character psyché)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Chaos\|Chaos]] (6, 5) = This type of person can tolerate disorder. The fact that things are not in their place does not bother them at all (and honestly, they kind of like it because order is boring). It seems they navigate best in chaos—where things don’t necessarily have a head or tail. In extreme cases, they are the king of disorder and chaos, having mess everywhere. (But they know their way around it, at least in 60% of cases). However, their improvisation skills are really strong.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Balance\|Balance]] (4, 3) = This type of person can tolerate a bit of disorder, as long as there is a good reason for it (like when renovating an apartment). But long-term disorder can frustrate them and worsen their overall mood.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Order\|Order]] (2, 1) = This person loves routine and when everything is in its place. They hate disorder (you could even call it an allergy) and are totally lost in chaos (or anything that deviates from order). Things must have a head and a tail. In extreme cases, they are the king of order and routine.
