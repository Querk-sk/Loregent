#### Perception of the World (character psyché)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Optimism\|Optimism]] (6, 5) = This person perceives the world as better than it actually is and mainly experiences positive emotions. They see the glass as half-full and focus on the full part. In extreme cases, they are like a small sunshine, able to be happy (and spread happiness) even in a total disaster.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Realism\|Realism]] (4, 3) = This person perceives the world as it actually is (or at least tries to). When they see the glass as half-empty, they prepare for the possibility that it will be completely empty. If the glass is filled, they are glad their fears were unfounded.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Pessimism\|Pessimism]] (2, 1) = This person perceives the world as worse than it actually is and mainly experiences negative emotions. They see the glass as half-empty and focus on the empty part. In extreme cases, they are like a total dark cloud, able to be unhappy (and see bad things) even in completely positive situations or celebrations.
