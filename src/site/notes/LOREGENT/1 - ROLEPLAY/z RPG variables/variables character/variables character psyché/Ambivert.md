#### Ambivert (spoločenskosť)

This is a person who doesn’t mind solitude or company, as long as it’s not extreme or for too long. For example, they couldn't handle a deserted island, but also wouldn't enjoy a crowded disco. This person can tolerate people and work with them (as long as it’s not for too long, like meeting new people all week during lectures where they're the center of attention). They enjoy making new contacts but prefer turning them into long-term friends.
