#### Trust in others (character psyché)

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Paranoia\|Paranoia]] (6, 5) = This person is hard to convince and always needs some proof. When walking down a quiet alley, they expect an attack. In extreme cases, this person trusts virtually nothing and no one (regardless of evidence). They need multiple reassurances that nothing is happening and that no one wants to deceive them.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Average Trust\|Average Trust]] (4, 3) = This person knows the world is a dangerous place, but also knows it’s not always so. If they are walking down a quiet alley in a safe part of town, they know they are not in danger. In a dangerous part of town, they are cautious.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Trust\|Trust]] (2, 1) = This person knows there are bad people, but believes there is good in every bad person—it just needs to be brought out. Maybe it’s all about the approach. No one is bad; maybe they just had a bad day. And if walking down a quiet alley, even in a dangerous part of town, they will behave as usual, believing they are not in danger. In extreme cases (2b), this person does not believe there are bad people or bad places. They essentially don't check people out. If they are walking down a quiet alley in the most dangerous part of town, they will be singing, believing nothing can harm them.
