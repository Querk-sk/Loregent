#### Supporting Character

What it is = A character that serves one or two functions in the story. They can also be a stronger version of an "unimportant character."

For example = A merchant who sells items and also gives quests to characters. Or like the strong special zombies (Witch) in Left 4 Dead.

Permissions = They can use attributes, skills, talents, and all points (e.g., wealth). These attributes, etc., are at the level required by the story. Their level of points does not change much during the story. So a poor merchant will ultimately remain poor, even if the player brings them a ton of gold.

b. Attributes = 1 point

b. Skills = 6 points

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]] or by the weapon used.
