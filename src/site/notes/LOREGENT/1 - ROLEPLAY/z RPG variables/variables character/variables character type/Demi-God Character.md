What it is = A character never controlled by the narrator but important to the story. This character controls other characters "behind the scenes," influences events in the world, or creates new obstacles for the characters. This character is secret and can only be met by other characters when the divine character wants them to.

- Semi-divine characters appear most frequently in the story from this group. Often as some rulers or as servants of divine characters.    
- Divine characters appear much less frequently in the story. But they are also rulers who rule over everyone and cause great change when they intervene in the story.    
- Uber-divine characters are completely hidden, characters see them only when the uber-gods want. They can make massive changes in the story.    

For example = G-Man, Zeus, [[MON\|MON]] and the like.

Permissions = They do what the story requires. These characters cannot be killed but can be defeated and disappear for some time.

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the narrator.
