What it is = A character stronger than extras. This character doesnâ€™t have a name, just a single title and function.

For example = guards on the castle walls, snow demons, or like the special zombies (Spitter) in Left 4 Dead.

Permissions = One attribute (maximum two) is assigned in which points can be placed (e.g., only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]). Additionally, a talent or specialization is determined, and the character receives the same number of points in it as in the main [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]]. The number of points a character can get is determined by their level or by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

b. Attributes = Determined by level. Points can be placed in one or a maximum of two Attributes (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2 or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 1). If an odd number of points, the first attribute gets more points. There can also be characters with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attributes.

b. Skills = The character has one [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] - but no points in skills. The number of points in talent and specialization is determined by level.

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].
