##### Strength ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]])

Represents overall muscle strength. Strong characters can lift heavy objects or are excellent carriers (like those in the high mountains). Additionally, they have great endurance in terms of stamina (for example, they can run a marathon) and in terms of injury (they can endure more hits).
