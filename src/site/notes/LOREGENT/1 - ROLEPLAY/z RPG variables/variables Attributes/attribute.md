#### INFO Attribute

Passive attributes are characteristics that indicate what a character is strong, average, or weak in. They are called 'passive' because they are not "rolled" – only skills are rolled with dice. For example, when a character needs to push a stone, the player doesn't roll the 'strength ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]])' attribute but rolls the '[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]' skill, which includes the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] (so the dice roll would be 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]])
