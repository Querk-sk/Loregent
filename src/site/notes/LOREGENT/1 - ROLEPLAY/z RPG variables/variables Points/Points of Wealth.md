#### INFO Points of Wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] indicate how much money a character has. Their amount is determined by the narrator and unless otherwise specified, each character receives 50 points of wealth at the beginning of the game. These can be increased when the character invests in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute (for +/- 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]], they receive +/- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] points of wealth). Additionally, wealth can be increased by selling, stealing, or completing tasks.
