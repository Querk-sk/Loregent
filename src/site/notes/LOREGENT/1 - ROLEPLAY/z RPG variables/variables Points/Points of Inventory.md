#### INFO Points of Inventory

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Inventory\|Inventory]] is the place where a character stores their items, such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]], tools, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapons]] or any other [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] things. The entire body of the character is considered as part of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Inventory\|Inventory]], including their hands, legs, head, torso, and backpack. So, when a character drops an item or the entire backpack (or gently places it on the ground), these dropped items no longer burden the character because they are not on their body.
