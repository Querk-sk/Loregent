#### INFO Points of Reward

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] do not exist by themselves; they are a game mechanic through which a character receives rewards for defeating a group of enemies, completing a task, or for the player role-playing their character very well (like a good actor). These points are used to increase [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|points of training]], increase [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]], to restore other points that the character had previously spent (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|points of speed]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]], etc.), or to obtain an item.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] are always given by the narrator and the player should use them as soon as possible.

The rule about reward points only applies to player-controlled characters. Other characters controlled by the narrator do not receive any rewards.
