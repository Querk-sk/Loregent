#### INFO Points of Speed

Points of Speed determine the order in combat and also indicate how many items a character can take into their inventory. The number of speed points is determined by the narrator. However, unless otherwise specified, each character receives **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] of speed** (this applies to all characters, as well as monsters or animals).
