### Victory levels

The outcome of the action is the final phase of the combat round, in which the winner of that combat round is determined, as well as what happens to the loser of that combat round. The winner of the combat round is the character who rolled the most [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] on their dice. The number of their success are subtracted from the number of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/success\|success]] of the opposing character who lost the combat roll. The remainder is converted into the so-called victory level. The winner can inflict injury on their enemy, disarm them, or do other things—depending on the victory level achieved.

In the case when the combat roll is tied, meaning both sides rolled the same number of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]], the combat round ends in a draw. In this case, the characters' attacks are simply deflected, or they miss each other.

> [!example]
> - A knight and a bandit are fighting each other.
> - The knight rolls their combat roll and gets 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]].
> - The bandit rolls their combat roll and gets 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]].
> - The bandit won the combat roll and achieved a victory level of 2.

The attacker who achieved a certain victory level can choose one option from the list below. When making the selection, they must consider whether they are a pacifist (which requires using a pacifist option) and what weapon they attacked with, as the weapon determines the level of injury ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|see the weapons chapter]]).

#### Reservation of successes

The character who won the combat round can choose only one option from the available victory levels. If the character achieved more [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] than necessary for the chosen option, the remaining [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] remain unused. However, these [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] are not wasted because the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] that the character did not use in their combat round carry over to the next combat roll. These [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] will reduce the total number of dice the character can roll in the next combat roll—thus reserving the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] for the next roll.

> [!info] In-game, it will look like this: :
> The attacker rolled 6 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] and used the option from victory level 4.
> Therefore, they have 2 unused [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] left. These [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] will carry over to the second round.
> If the attacker has 8 dice for the combat roll, they will lose 2 dice in the next round (as they are automatically converted into [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]]), and the next combat roll will be thrown with 6 dice.

The reservation must be approved by the narrator, and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] cannot be carried over indefinitely.

#### List of victory levels

The character who won the combat round can choose one of the available options based on the number of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] they achieved. These options are sorted according to the level required to activate them. However, the character can choose a lower level option, even if they achieved more [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]].

##### Victory Level 1

###### Change in Combat Distance (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack and quickly moves to a better position. This increase (or decrease) in combat distance between the enemy and the character lasts until another change in distance occurs (e.g., if the enemy wins the combat round and uses this option).

- For every **1 victory level**, the character can change their combat distance by 1.    
- The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the distance the character covers (+1 for each point).    
- If the character has unused points from weapon specialization (e.g., the distance can be changed by 1, but the character has 3 points in specialization), the unused points reserve [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] for the next round.

###### Gaining Initiative (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack, slowing them down and gaining an advantage. This initiative gain lasts for 1 round.
- For every **1 victory level**, the character advances 1 level in combat initiative in the next round (as if they suddenly had a higher REF by 1 point).    
- The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the distance the character covers (+1 for each point).     
- If the character has unused points from weapon specialization (e.g., the initiative can be changed by 1, but the character has 3 points in specialization), the unused points reserve [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] for the next round.

###### Stagger (pacifist)

Pacifist option. For each 1 victory level, the enemy loses 1 die in the next round. The loss of dice applies only for 1 round.

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the number of dice the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

###### Adding Damaging Points (optional)

When the narrator uses other points than those already in our RPG system, this option becomes available. If not, this option is ignored.

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the number of offensive points the enemy receives (+1 for each point).

For each 1 victory level, the enemy receives 1 offensive point. This could be pain, stress, heat, etc. The rules for offensive points are found in the chapter [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Other points\|Various points]].

> [!example]
> **Pain**
> Pain points are used when the attacker causes pain instead of injury to their victim. The attacker can exchange 1 victory level for 1 pain point (which the victim receives). When the victim accumulates 10 pain points, they can no longer fight and drop out of the combat as the pain becomes unbearable and they pass out. The victim can use 1 health point to "cleanse" 3 pain points.

###### Injury (dmg)

Injury is an offensive option. For each 1 victory level, the enemy receives 1 injury point. The maximum amount of injury is determined by the weapon, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|specialization]] for that weapon, and the enemy's armor.

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the amount of injury the enemy receives (+1 for each point).

> [!example]
> The character rolled their attack roll and achieved 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]].
> If the character has a weapon with attack 1, they will deal 1 damage to the enemy.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 3, they will deal 3 damage to the enemy.

##### Victory Level 2

###### Gaining a Quick Action (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack, slowing them down and gaining an advantage.

- For every **2 victory levels**, the character gains +1 quick action in the next round.

###### Damaging Armor  (pacifist)

The character uses their weapon to damage the enemy's armor. For every 2 victory levels, the enemy loses 1 armor point until the end of the battle. (Or until repaired - it depends on the game settings)

If the enemy has armor that is resistant to the character's weapon, the armor damage is halved (rounded down).

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the amount of armor the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

###### Poškodenie zbrane (pacifist)

The character uses their weapon to damage the enemy's weapon. For every 2 victory levels, the enemy loses 1 point from the weapon's attack attribute until the end of the battle. (Or until repaired - it depends on the game settings)

The number of points the attacker has invested in their combat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the amount of armor the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

(Attack attributes of the weapon are considered to be all attributes the weapon possesses that help the character. This includes magic, reloading speed, etc. The player must specify which attribute they want to reduce.)

##### Victory Level  3

###### Pain (pacifist)

The character inflicts an unpleasant injury on the enemy, such as scratching or striking them hard. It's nothing serious, but the enemy will feel it until the end of the fight.

- For every **3 victory levels**, the enemy loses 1 die from their attack until the end of the fight.    
- The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the number of dice the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

###### Disarmament (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character uses their speed and skill to disarm the enemy. The enemy will be disarmed until the end of the fight (but at least for 1 whole combat round).

To find their weapon again, the enemy needs to overcome a CL determined by the number of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] from the character's roll. They roll the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]. Finding the weapon is considered a quick action.

###### Knockdown (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character uses their speed or strength to knock down the enemy. The knocked-down enemy cannot move, cannot change combat distances, and can only defend.

To stand up again, the enemy needs to overcome a CL determined by the number of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] from the character's roll. They roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]. The attempt to stand up is considered a quick action.

##### Victory Level 4

###### Gaining a Slow Action (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack, slowing them down and gaining an advantage.

- For every **4 victory levels**, the character gains +1 slow action in the next round.

###### Severing a Limb (dmg)

This is an offensive option. The character severs the enemy's arm or leg (or another limb). The enemy permanently loses 1 whole attribute (refer to the list of disadvantages - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Disabling Characteristic#item 6 - Missing Limb\|missing limb]]). Additionally, the enemy receives a bleeding status, losing 1 health point per round until the bleeding is stopped.

The difficulty of stopping the bleeding is determined by the number of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] from the character's roll.

##### Victory Level 5 and Above

###### K.O. (dmg / pacifist )

When the character's number of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/successes\|successes]] is higher by 1 than the remaining health points of the enemy (along with the remaining armor points), the character can choose one of these options:

- **K.O. (? dmg/pacif - decided by the narrator)**    
    - The enemy falls into a coma and drops out of the fight. If the character wants to additionally kill the enemy, they must overcome a difficulty level of 1 in their combat roll. The enemy's armor is not counted during this attack.        
- **Surrender (pacif)**    
    - The character forces the enemy to surrender. The enemy drops out of the fight, and the character can also bind them (automatically, without any dice roll).        
- **Death (dmg)**    
    - The character kills the enemy with one brutal strike.
