### Combat circumstances

In combat, various things can happen that affect its course. Below is a list of combat circumstances and their impacts on the fight.

#### Advantageous position

This circumstance occurs when the character gets into a better position than the enemy. The enemy may fall into water or be trapped in bushes, while the character stands firmly on the ground.

The advantaged character rolls with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|advantage]], or if the advantage is very significant, with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|great advantage]].

#### Surprise

"Surprise" occurs when the character attacks an enemy who is attacking someone else. Or when the enemy is engaged in another activity during which they are "oblivious to the surrounding world".

During surprise, the character gets +2 extra dice on their roll.

(The enemy's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] functions normally.)

#### Dual Wielding

When the character has the talent for dual wielding and attacks with two [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapons]], the attacks from both weapons are combined.

#### Fighting multiple enemies

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|Fighting]] multiple enemies occurs when the character decides to attack several attackers or when several attackers attack the character. In the case of fighting multiple enemies, the combat roll is thrown the same as in any other fight. However, the character's victories are compared against the victories of all participating opponents - each individually as if fighting 1vs1.

The number of enemies the character can fight and injure is limited by the size of their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]].

- Hand protectors / unarmed fighting = 1 attacker    
- Small weapons = 2 attackers    
- Medium weapons = 3 attackers    
- Large weapons = 4 attackers

The number of enemies increases according to how many points the character has in specialization (+1 for each point).

When there are more enemies, if the character [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|wins]], they can only injure a certain number of enemies (for example, 2). The remaining enemies who lost the fight - the character deflects the attack. The narrator decides which enemies this applies to.
