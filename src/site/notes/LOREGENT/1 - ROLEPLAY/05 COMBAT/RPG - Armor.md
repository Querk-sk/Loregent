### Armor

Armor is a passive protection that shields a character from damage in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]] or during a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|quick solution to the situation]]. The number of armor points is determined by the narrator. Unless otherwise specified, every character receives **0 armor points**.

Armor can be increased with items like helmets, gloves, or bulletproof vests. Armor can also be permanently increased by a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk\|natural trait]] the character is born with (e.g., a turtle's shell).

There is no maximum armor level, but it can only be reduced to zero. Armor does not go into negative numbers.

#### How Armor Works

Unless otherwise specified, armor is a passive protection that shields [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] by reducing the damage a character would receive from an attacker.

>[!example]
>- The enemy rolls 6 victories in their combat roll
>- The character rolls 2 victories in their combat roll.
> <br>
>- The character's health points should decrease by 4 points.
>- However, the character has 3 armor points.
>- Therefore, their health points decrease by only 1.

Although armor reduces damage, it does not reduce the victory level. So if a character wins the combat roll but does not cause any injury to the enemy, they can use other options listed in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|chapter on victory levels]].

#### Armor Strength

Each piece of protective gear adds armor points directly. All armor points (even from multiple items) are then totaled together. So if a character is wearing, for example, a helmet +1, body armor +3, and boots +2, their armor score would be 6. Armor is calculated separately only when an enemy or character decides to attack a specific part of the body (e.g., attacking the hands).

The armor level of a given item is not judged by the period or genre in which the story takes place. Whether it's medieval, sci-fi, or magical - an armor level of 1 represents weak or small armor, and a level of 5 represents large or high-quality armor.

1. Weak or small armor    
2. Below-average armor or medium armor    
3. Average armor or standard size    
4. Above-average armor or larger    
5. High-quality armor or largest

#### Armor Specialization

All information on specialization can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization#Specialization and Armor\|relevant chapter]]. But in short: the number of points a character invests in specialization for a certain type of armor (e.g., samurai armor) increases their armor points for that specific armor when equipped.

Armor specialization must be tied to a job, type of martial arts, or specific magic. A character cannot have a general light armor specialization for all kinds of light armor but must specify the type, such as light samurai armor.

#### Types of Armor

However, the rating of armor does not end with a number. Each armor must also have its type specified, which indicates which type of weapon the armor is resistant to and which it is weak against. In our RPG system, we divide armor by resistance (against weapons) into three types:

- **Light Armor**: resistant to one type of weapon. It has a weight of 1, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to multiple skills.    
- **Medium Armor**: resistant to two types of weapons. Its weight is 2, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to one skill.    
- **Heavy Armor**: resistant to three types of weapons. Its weight is 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it cannot add points to skills.    

This resistance can manifest in the game in various ways. Either the light armor gets damaged after each successful enemy attack, or the light armor won't protect the character as well. The narrator can decide which method to use, create their own method, or combine multiple methods.

##### Armor Damage

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain type of weapon. After each successful enemy attack, the armor is slightly damaged, reducing the armor points by 1. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the weak armor takes full damage.    
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain type of weapon. Therefore, it does not get damaged during a successful enemy attack. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the resistant armor takes only half damage.    
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)    

Damaged armor can be repaired by a blacksmith, or if the character has the appropriate talent and tools, they can repair the armor themselves.

##### Armor Effectiveness

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 2 armor points block only 1 damage point.    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is weak against the given weapon). The enemy receives 3 damage points.        
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 1 armor point blocks 2 damage points (i.e., the number of damage points is halved, rounded down).    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is resistant to the given weapon). The enemy receives 0 damage points.        
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)

##### In Our Universe

In our story universe, armor is divided according to the type of weapon attack it faces (see the list):

###### Against Blunt Weapons and Explosives
- This armor is resistant to blunt weapons and explosives. This means that blunt weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Blunt Weapons\|Blunt Weapons]] are: hammers, maces, clubs, and similar. Also includes blunt throwing weapons.)    
- (Explosives fall under [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Explosive Weapons\|Explosive Weapons]]. These include: grenades, explosive arrows, explosive spells, and similar.)

###### Against Sharp Weapons
- This armor is resistant to sharp weapons. This means that sharp weapons do not harm this armor. 
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Sharp Weapons\|Sharp Weapons]] are: axes, swords, katanas, knives, shurikens, and similar. Also includes sharp throwing weapons.)

###### Against Piercing Weapons
- This armor is resistant to piercing weapons. This means that piercing weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- Applies to ranged and stabbing weapons.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Piercing Weapons\|Ranged Weapons]] are: arrows, bullets—everything shot from a weapon (not throwing weapons).    
- (Stabbing weapons: rapiers, spears, and other weapons designed for stabbing.)

###### Mixed Armor
- A character's armor is "mixed" when they wear pieces of various types of armor on their body.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

 ###### Without Armor
- A character is "without armor" when they have no items or clothing on their body that could be considered armor. Or when it is natural armor, like a turtle's shell.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

#### Armor and Elements

In our universe, the rule is that every armor is weak against all elements unless it has magical resistance against a particular element.

Regarding elements in general, our story universe follows the rule that all elements are equal. This means that no element is inherently weak against another element.

However, if the narrator wants certain elements to be stronger or weaker against each other (similar to the game Pokémon), they can follow the chapter on "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Monsters from Pocket#Elements\|Pocket Monsters]]."

#### Energy Armor

This is protection that uses energy (magic or photons) instead of solid materials (such as iron). Energy armor functions similarly to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]. When a character takes damage, their energy armor points are depleted before their health points. Once the energy armor is depleted, the character is no longer protected.

Such armor can also be recharged. The method depends on the story (sometimes a specific item or battery is needed, or if it's magic, the shield is charged from the character's energy through a spell). The narrator sets the limitations of energy armor and its recharging options. The narrator may decide that the armor can be recharged automatically after combat or, in certain cases (using a spell or item), even during combat.

Energy armor does not affect the character's weight. Some weapons may be more effective against it (meaning some weapons deplete 2 or 3 points instead of 1). Some elements may completely ignore it (e.g., a poisonous cloud that depletes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] directly).

In close combat, energy armor functions normally.

#### Magical Armor Abilities

Magical properties of armor are special abilities that provide additional protection or advantage to a character. To activate these properties, the character must meet certain conditions. Some magical properties are activated by spells, or a combination of talent, skill, or specialization. Other magical properties are activated when certain numbers or ranges of numbers are rolled on the dice.

> [!example]
> * **Thorn Armor** - When a 1 is rolled on the dice, the enemy receives as much damage as the number of dice with a 1.
> * **Ice Armor** - Reduces the speed of nearby characters by 1 point (speed) for as many rounds as the character rolled victories.
> * **Spider Armor** - The character can use the "pull" spell. It combines Dexterity + specialization in Spider Armor. The character chooses a target, and the narrator determines the difficulty level.

These magical properties can only be activated when the character has a specialization for a specific type of armor. So if the character has a specialization in heavy armor and is wearing heavy armor with magical properties, they can use the magical properties. If they had a different armor, they could not. The number of points invested in specialization adds dice to the roll or shifts the activation threshold.

- Specialization 1, 2 = when a 1 is rolled    
- Specialization 3, 4 = when a 1, 2 is rolled    
- Specialization 5, 6 = when a 1, 2, 3 is rolled (3 is the maximum)

> [!example]
> For protective properties, numbers 1, 2, 3 are used. For supportive or offensive properties, numbers 4, 5, 6 are used.

As for the cost, magical properties are considered armor points. So if heavy armor has 3 armor points and magical properties add 2 points, the cost will be the same as if the heavy armor had 5 armor points.

In terms of weight, magical properties do not count towards the weight. However, the narrator can change this and, for example, increase the armor's weight.
