### Combat

Combat is a conflict between two characters, where one character attacks the other with a weapon to defeat them. The result of combat is the reduction of the enemy's or character's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health points]], or the infliction of a condition, such as stunning. In combat, all attributes, specializations, and possibly also the skills of both characters are taken into account. So, the outcome of combat is determined by a combination of the characters' physical abilities and their knowledge of combat.

Combat can be fought with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Chrániče na ruky\|hands]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Zbrane na blízko\|melee weapons]] (e.g., swords), [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Zbrane na diaľku a na hádzanie\|ranged weapons]] (e.g., pistols), [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Basics of Magic\|spells]], or combat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuvers]] (e.g., a character runs and knocks the enemy to the ground).

#### Combat Rounds

Combat is divided into rounds. In each round, the players (and the narrator) state what they want their characters to do. Once everyone agrees on a certain action, dice are rolled to determine who wins that round. The dice decide everything, but the narrator provides the final outcome. When the action of every character involved in the combat is completed, the round ends, and the next round begins.

However, actions are not limited to just fighting or moving (or fleeing). A character can do anything that a normal person could accomplish in a few seconds. Overturning a table, throwing a stone at the enemy's head, or drawing a weapon. Simply shouting to another character is not considered an action. For details on what a character can do during combat, refer to the chapter on “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|Combat Maneuvers]]”.

Each combat round is divided into steps: Declaration of Action, Execution of Action, and Result of Action.

##### Step 1 - Declaration of Action

Each character can perform one action in a round, or more, depending on the chosen [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]]. All characters' actions occur simultaneously during combat, even though they are announced sequentially by the narrator or players. However, the declaration of action has its order, which is determined by speed points.

- The character with the fewest speed points speaks first about what they would like to do.    
- Then the character with more points goes next.    
- And then the next character with more points speaks,    
- and so on,    
- until the character with the most speed points announces last what they would like to do.

This order is important because faster characters react to what slower characters do.

>[!example]
> - A knight is fighting against a bandit and has fewer [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed points]] than the bandit.
> - Let's say they are fighting in a tavern, and to make it easier for the knight to attack, he wants to jump onto a table.
> - The bandit (who has more speed points) decides to kick the table to knock the knight off.
> - The knight cannot change his decision because he is slower than the bandit.

For simplicity, it is good for characters to attack each other one-on-one. However, in some combats, this is not possible, and multiple characters may fight simultaneously. The number of opponents a character can defend against is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Podľa veľkosti zbrane\|type of weapon]] and the number of points in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]].

>[!example]
> If a character has a weapon - hand protectors, they can fight against 1 enemy +1 for each point in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]].

##### Step 2 - Execution of Action

Once everyone has stated what they plan to do during the round, dice rolls can proceed. A standard combat roll is performed as follows:

- 3 dice as a base    
- plus dice for each point in all Attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]])    
- plus dice for each point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] for the weapon (if the character has it in hand)    
- plus dice from skills (if using a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]])    
- plus/minus dice for circumstances

>[!example]
> The Black Knight challenges the Green Knight to a duel. The Black Knight's attack is calculated as:
>
>* 3 Dice as a base
>* plus 2 from Attributes ( [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 0 , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] 0 , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] 1 )
>* plus 2 from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] in medium swords (as he is attacking with such a sword)
> * Resulting in 7 dice for the attack.

Combat rolls are also performed in order, but from the fastest character to the slowest. The character with the most speed points executes their action first. Only the dice determine whether they succeed or fail.

> [!example] Continuation of the bandit example
> The bandit will roll the dice first, and the knight second. The narrator decides that the bandit cannot use the weapon bonus or their combat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] for the attack roll because they are attempting to kick the table.
>
>If the bandit fails - the table remains stable, and the knight gains an advantage.
>If the bandit succeeds - they kick the table, causing it to become unstable.
>Then the narrator instructs the knight to roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] against a challenge level depending on the number of victories the bandit achieved.
>
>The knight rolls the dice.
>If the knight succeeds - they stay on the table and gain an advantage.
>If the knight fails - they fall off the table and will be at a disadvantage.

Regarding the combat roll and assistance, combat rolls cannot be assisted, and victories cannot be transferred. Therefore, if one character tries to help another, they can only do so by fighting together, with two characters attacking the enemy instead of one.

##### Step 3 - Result of Action

The winner of the combat round is the character who rolled the most victories. Their number of victories is subtracted from the number of victories of the character who lost the combat roll, and the remainder is converted into what is called a victory level. Based on the achieved level, the winner of the combat round can cause an injury to their opponent, disarm them, or perform other actions (see the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|victory levels]]).

In general, there are two categories of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|victory levels]]: offensive and pacifist.

**Offensive** levels are those that cause injury to the victim (reduction of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health points]]), bodily damage (e.g., severing a hand), or permanent reduction of an attribute or skill (something similar to severing a hand).

Regarding injury, it is important to know what kind of attack the character's weapon has, as the attack's strength determines how much damage the enemy takes. A character can achieve a higher victory level, but if they have a weak weapon, the enemy's damage will be lower. The amount of damage is also influenced by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization#Weapon Specialization\|weapon specialization]].

> [!example]
> The character rolled their attack and achieved 4 victories.
> If the character has a weapon with an attack of 1, they will cause 1 damage to the enemy.
> If the character has a weapon with an attack of 3, they will cause 3 damage to the enemy.

**Pacifist** victory level options do not harm the enemy but only reduce the dice during combat or cause the enemy to be knocked out (KO) – meaning they drop out of the fight.

In case of a **tied combat roll** – where both characters roll the same number of victories, the attack is deflected and no one wins the combat roll.

In the case where one character fights **against multiple enemies** and that one character wins (or loses) – the number of victories from their combat roll is compared to the number of victories of each individual enemy separately. It may happen that they win against one enemy while losing against another.

However, the third step (the result of action) does not have to be the last in the combat round. Characters have other ways to gain additional victories in their combat roll. They can use another maneuver or sacrifice some of their points. More on this topic can be found in the chapters [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|Actions during Combat]].

#### Social Combat

This is a different form of regular combat, where characters do not fight with weapons but with arguments. The result of such combat is convincing the opponent under difficult circumstances - for example, when a detective tries to convict a perpetrator, a lawyer talks to a witness, or a diplomat resolves an international dispute. Social combat can be used in various situations. Compared to normal combat, there are several differences.

- In social combat, skills from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute are used (the number of dice is therefore not counted from all attributes as in regular combat).    
- The order in “social combat” is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute.    
- Arguments, facts, and evidence add dice to the roll.    
    - Evidence is something the character can hold or show - for example, a photo from the crime scene or the victim's diary.        
    - Fact - is a “tool” the character creates. This is done by rolling an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|assist roll]] of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]” against CL 3. The character recalls some information. However, if it is a common fact, the character can also use a book or an encyclopedia excerpt as evidence.        
    - Argument - is a “tool” the character creates. This is done by rolling an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|assist roll]] of an applicable [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] skill against CL 3 (or, if the narrator allows, another skill in combination with a talent - but only logically applicable).        
    - The strength of the fact and argument is determined by the number of victories rolled in the assist roll.        
    - For evidence, a scale can be used - 1 weak, 5 strong.        
- The opponent can use their victory level to “destroy” the evidence, argument, or fact, or to "destroy" the opponent.    
- Instead of health points, "social points" are used in social combat, which function exactly like health points, except that when they run out, the opponent convinces the character (or otherwise forces them to change their opinion).
