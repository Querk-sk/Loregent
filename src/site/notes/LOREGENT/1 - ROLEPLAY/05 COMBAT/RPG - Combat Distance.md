### Distance

Distance is a combat circumstance that determines when characters can attack each other and with which weapon. Distance is assessed according to a scale that the narrator can adjust to their needs. This scale can be used not only in sword fights but also in battles with spaceships.

#### Categories of Distance

##### Close Combat

- Characters are close to each other like boxers or in MMA.    
- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would stand on the same square, right next to each other.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 0 - 1 m.

##### Normal Distance

- Characters are close enough that their swords touch, but they are further apart than boxers.    
- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would stand on the same square, but each piece would be further apart - on the line that borders the square.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 2 m - 3 m.

##### Within Reach

- Characters are a bit further apart, but if they have a long sword in their hands and extend their arm, they will touch the opponent's long sword.    
- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, each piece would stand on its own (adjacent) square.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 4 m - 5 m.

##### Further

- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would be separated by two empty squares up to 20 squares.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 10 m - 100 m.

##### Even Further

- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would be separated by 40 to 100 squares.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 200 m - 500 m.

##### Far

- In reality, this could be approximately 600 m - 1 km.

#### Starting Position

>[!example]
> All sizes, squares, distances, and scales can be adjusted by the narrator according to their needs. They can decide that one square equals 5 m, or 1 km. Alternatively, when using a map, they can decide that 5 cm equals 5 meters.

The so-called “Normal Distance” is the starting position for every combat. Thus, 99% of combats in all games start at this distance. To move to a more advantageous position, characters must win a combat roll.

If a player wants the combat to start (for them) in an advantageous position, they must attack when the opponent is unaware of the combat. They can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] to approach unnoticed, or they can use, for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] - where the character rushes at the enemy. As for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Zbrane na diaľku a na hádzanie\|ranged weapons]], they can start the combat from their current position.

>[!info] 
>The maximum walking speed is 6 km/h or 2 m/s. If a character walks slower, it can be 1 m/s or even 0.5 m/s.

Distance and movement speed are also influenced by the size of the character. More on this is written in the chapter [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Size of the character\|Character Size]].
