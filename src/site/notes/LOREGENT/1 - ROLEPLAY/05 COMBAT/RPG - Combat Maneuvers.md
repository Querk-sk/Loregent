### Combat Maneuvers and Actions During Battle

Maneuvers or actions during battle are divided into three categories: "Slow Action," "Fast Action," and "Very Fast Action."

- "**Slow Action**" requires concentration or more than 2 seconds to complete, or it results in a full injury to the enemy (or another full disadvantage).    
- "**Fast Action**" requires less concentration or can be done within 2 seconds, or it has a smaller impact on the enemy's injury (or another disadvantage).    
- "**Very Fast Action**" is something that requires the least concentration and can be done within one second, or it has a minimal impact on the enemy (not resulting in any injury or limitation), or it is an action that must be performed (e.g., a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|activity check]]). The decision to perform a very fast action is made by the narrator.

During battle, a character can perform only one "slow action" or two "fast actions."

A character can (but does not have to) perform one additional "very fast action" during battle (this does not affect the total number of actions a character can perform during battle, as its execution is decided solely by the narrator).


##### More Actions

When a character runs out of actions and needs to do something else, they can sacrifice some of their points to take an additional action.

A character gains 1 fast action by sacrificing:
- (either) 2 dice from the next roll (this reduction lasts until the end of the battle)    
- (or) 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]    
- (or) 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]

A character gains 1 slow action by sacrificing:
- (either) 4 dice from the next roll (this reduction lasts until the end of the battle)    
- (or) 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]    
- (or) 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]

The sacrifice of points can occur before rolling the dice, or as a reaction to a dice roll (either their own or the enemy's).

A character can make only one sacrifice per dice roll. It’s best to use the acquired actions in the same round, although actions can carry over from one round to the next. This means that if a character does not use all their actions (e.g., they have one fast action left), they can use this unused action in the next round (but only in the next one - actions created from sacrifices do not carry over indefinitely).

#### Maneuvers by Impact on the Enemy

Maneuvers are also classified by their impact on the enemy into:
- Offensive (causing damage to the enemy)    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] (where the activity helps the character or allies)    
- Pacifistic (not causing damage to the enemy but disadvantaging them, e.g., stunning)

#### List of Maneuvers

Below is a list of maneuvers. It’s divided into categories for clarity, but the character can choose from any category and any maneuver each round. The character is not restricted in this regard.

##### Movement

Movement allows a character to get into a better position, hide, or dodge an attack. It can also enable the character to use their speed to injure the enemy.

###### Quick Move - vf

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed before rolling dice - very fast action.

**Description:** It is a quick move within 2 meters or within 1 second. For example, when a character passes through a door, hides behind a cupboard (must be close by), or jumps through a window (when standing next to it). It must be a move that does not require any dice roll and has no level of complexity. When the move requires a dice roll or has a level of complexity, "quick move" is replaced with "regular move."

**Repetition:** Quick move can be used only once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. There are no benefits from specialization or talent.

###### Regular Move - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed (or rolled) before rolling dice - fast action.

**Description:** It is a move within a larger area than 2 meters or lasting more than 2 seconds. For example, when a character passes through a door (from a distance), hides behind a cupboard (even if it is further away), or jumps through a window (even if it is further away). It is a movement that requires a skill roll against the level of complexity.

For a “regular move,” you roll:

- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] (for speed or distance),    
- or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] (for handling difficult terrain, e.g., height differences or deep snow),    
- or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] (when jumping over an obstacle).    

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]] is determined by meters - for every additional 2 meters, add 1 CL (starting from 0, so 4m = CL 1, 6m = CL 2, etc.), and the complexity of the obstacle also increases CL (+1 for something easier, +2 for something complex, +3 for something very complex).

**Repetition:** Regular move can be repeated several times in one round, even between two attacks (the character moves, attacks, and moves again). It works as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent for movement, they can use it for this maneuver.

 ###### Shift in Combat Distance - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed before rolling dice - slow action.

**Description:** It is a shift in combat distance by 1, for example, from close combat to regular combat, etc. This move does not require any skill roll.

**Repetition:** The shift in combat distance can be used multiple times in one combat round, but consecutively (e.g., the character shifts by 1+1 positions within [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance\|combat distance]]).

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. There are no benefits from specialization or talent.

###### Stealthy Approach - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed (or rolled) before the main attack - slow action.

**Description:** It involves controlling the character's movement so that no one sees or hears them. The purpose of this movement is to get the character into a better position, or ideally, directly behind the enemy, where they can neutralize them quickly.

For a "secret approach," the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill is rolled against the enemy's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill as a passive conflict (i.e., in the case of a tie, the enemy wins). The enemy may receive more or fewer dice depending on the circumstances (e.g., fog or dry leaves that rustle), or based on the items they have (e.g., night vision).

The narrator decides how many times the character must roll "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]]" to get behind the enemy (or to do what they want to do). This number is determined by meters - for every additional 2 meters, add 1 roll (so 2m = 1 roll, 4m = 2 rolls, 6m = 3 rolls, etc.). The narrator can increase or decrease the CL based on the obstacle or circumstance (+1 for something easier, +2 for something complex, +3 for something very complex).

If the character wins all the rolls in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they reach the enemy from behind and can make an attack against CL0. Each win counts as direct damage to the enemy (or as a level of victory), and the enemy's armor is ignored.

If the character loses, the enemy sees them and can attack. The wins the enemy gained in the last roll carry over to the next attack.

**Repetition:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] is rolled every round. If the character is revealed, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] can no longer be rolled.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent for silent movement, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Charge - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled instead of an attack - slow action.

**Description:** Charge is a combat maneuver based on the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]]." In this maneuver, the character runs towards the enemy and uses their speed and weight to knock them down. There must be a sufficient distance between the character and the enemy. Charge can be used within "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Reach\|Reach]]" distance (4m - 5m).

Each character (regardless of whether they have points in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]]" or not) receives an additional +3 dice for their roll during a charge. If the attacking character wins, they knock the enemy to the ground (see the "[[RPG - Levels of Victory\|Combat Result]]" chapter, option “[[RPG - Levels of Victory#Knockdown (pacif)\|Knockdown]]").

Defense against Charge includes: Resistance, Dodge, or a regular attack if the character has a shield or any loaded firearm.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, the charge can be rolled again as a normal roll. It can be used against another enemy. It can only be used against the same enemy when the character and enemy are within "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Reach\|Reach]]" distance (4m - 5m).

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate specialization that can be used for the charge, they can use it for this maneuver. (Talent cannot be used since Charge is a damaging maneuver).

##### Attack

Attack allows a character to damage the enemy or to disadvantage their enemy.

###### Pre-Attack Check - vf

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - very fast action.

**Description:** This is an activity check that determines if the character can attack when in challenging conditions (e.g., swimming in deep water). The character must first roll the skill related to the conditions (e.g., in deep water, the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill is rolled), with the complexity level determined by the narrator based on the circumstances.

The pre-attack check functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, the pre-attack check can be rolled again. It still functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Analysis of Weakness - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** Weakness detection determines if the character notices something that can be used in battle, a weakness of the enemy (e.g., bad posture, poorly fitted armor, improper weapon handling).

Weakness detection functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] and is rolled as the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once in battle.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. Without them, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Analysis of an Enemy  - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** The character thinks and searches their memory for information that could help in damaging the enemy. Analysis functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] and is rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] and can be combined with an appropriate item (e.g., a monster book).

**Repetition:** It can only be used once in battle.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. Without them, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Searching for an Item - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** The character finds an item that will help in battle (e.g., a bottle of gasoline, sand, rag). Searching for an item functions as an auxiliary roll and is rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], against the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Challenge Level\|level of complexity]], determined by a luck roll. (So if the character wants to find an item, first roll luck and then roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]).

The level (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|strength]]) of the item is determined by the number of wins the character gets from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill roll (which was reduced by the level of complexity).

The item found can be used in the next round, or if there are still unused actions, it can be used in the same round (see use of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] item). The item must be used as soon as possible and cannot be saved for later. It also cannot be sacrificed.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|Luck Dice]] and CL:
1. Massive Misfortune = CL 5 or CL +3    
2. Great Misfortune = CL 4 or CL +2    
3. Slight Misfortune = CL 3 or CL +1    
4. Slight Luck = CL 2 or CL -1    
5. Great Luck = CL 1 or CL -2    
6. Massive Luck = CL 0 or CL -3

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. In this case, it functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent, it can be used for this maneuver.

###### Vehicle Use - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** A character can use their vehicle in battle. They can maneuver it to ram the enemy or position it for better shooting. This maneuver is rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] with the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] skill connected to a talent related to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (e.g., fighter pilot).

Note: Though referred to as a vehicle, this maneuver applies to all machines that can be piloted, including aircraft, spaceships, and so on.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It still functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. Without them, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Use of an Animal - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** Control of commands for the animal, or control of the use of surrounding animals (e.g., scaring elephants). This control serves to make the animals attack the enemy or somehow make their life difficult.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Other skills#Talking to Animals / Controlling Animals\|Animal Use]] is rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|self-assistance roll]] and is rolled as a combination of any one skill from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] and a talent related to working with animals (e.g., beast tamer). The use of animals must be approved by the narrator.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. Without them, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Deceiving the Enemy - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** The character uses tricks to deceive the enemy. For example, pretending to attack from the other side or feigning defense.

Deceiving the enemy is rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|self-assistance roll]] and is rolled using the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] skill. If the character has an appropriate talent, it can also be used (e.g., illusionist, circus performer).

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]]. Without it, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Weapon as Armor - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action used during the attack - slow action. (No dice are rolled)

**Description:** The character must state that they are going to use their weapon as armor before the dice roll occurs.

All offensive attributes of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|melee weapon]] are "transformed" into armor and added to the armor the character is wearing. The type of armor will be the same as the armor the character is wearing. No dice roll is required for this maneuver.

Note - Only melee weapons can be used. Ranged or thrown weapons cannot be used.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] in the weapon. Without specialization, this maneuver cannot be used.

###### Regular Attack / Counterattack - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled as an attack - slow action

**Description:** It is a regular [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|attack]] with a weapon, without a weapon, or with anything intended to harm the enemy. All rules about weapons and combat apply to this maneuver.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** When a character uses a weapon that requires a talent or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] and does not have either, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Half Attack / Counterattack - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled as an attack - fast action

**Description:** It is an attack with a weapon, without a weapon, or with anything intended to harm the enemy. The number of dice the character can use in the battle is halved (and rounded down).

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** When a character uses a weapon that requires a talent or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] and does not have either, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Deflect Attack - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled instead of an attack - fast action

**Description:** Deflecting an attack serves to completely block the enemy's attack. If the character wins the combat roll, the enemy takes no damage. The character does not gain any benefits from a successful counterattack. It is rolled as a regular combat roll. Deflecting an attack can only be done with melee weapons.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** When a character uses a weapon that requires a talent or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] and does not have either, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Brace - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled instead of an attack - fast action.

**Description:** Bracing serves as a defense against a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers#Charge - s\|Charge]] or any object that is "charging" (e.g., rolling barrels). It is based on the "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" skill. The character creates a barrier with their body for the enemy to collide with.

Bracing is rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|self-assistance roll]]. Regardless of whether the character has points in the "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" skill or not, they receive an additional +1 die for their roll. A shield can be used in this maneuver (adding extra dice to the roll).

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent or specialization, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Dodging - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled instead of an attack - fast action.

**Description:** Dodging serves as a defense against the enemy's attack, where the character dodges the enemy. They can jump aside or perform some gymnastic maneuver. Dodging is based on the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]," which is the only one that provides dice for this maneuver (the character does not receive any additional dice for Dodging).

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent or specialization, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Damage Absorption - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action used instead of an attack - fast action.

**Description:** Damage absorption serves to reduce the damage that the character would receive. It is rolled as the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] skill, without the use of talent or items (which can only be used for sacrifice). Armor, shield, or weapon can be used in this roll - the number of points in armor (shield or weapon) is converted into dice, which increases the number of dice in the damage absorption roll.

The roll is made against the enemy's attack. The number of wins the character rolls is the amount by which their damage is reduced. The result of this roll is final, and the damage cannot be reduced further by armor.

Damage absorption serves to absorb the enemy's attack without causing any injury to the enemy. The character does not gain any benefits from a successful counterattack.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per combat round.

**Specialization:** Talent and specialization are not used for this maneuver.

##### Magic

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]] allows a character to damage their enemy, limit them in some way, or help their allies. The term “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]]” refers to all special traits, superpowers, magical abilities, or other unique skills of the character, including the use of sci-fi technology.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] Spell, Fast - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled instead of an attack - fast action

**Description:** The character casts a spell that helps them or someone else. This spell must be cast quickly (within 1 second) and must not directly harm the enemy (e.g., setting them on fire). The character can conjure a shield, a sword, or can speed up an ally, or extinguish them if they are on fire.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** The character must have talent. If they do not have talent, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the spell is quite complex, they roll at a great disadvantage.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] Spell, Slow - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled instead of an attack - slow action

**Description:** The same as a “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] Spell, Fast,” but casting this spell can take longer than 1 second.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** The character must have talent. If they do not have talent, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the spell is quite complex, they roll at a great disadvantage.

###### Spell Charging - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled instead of an attack - slow action

**Description:** This maneuver is used when the CL for the spell is too high or when the wizard wants to strengthen their spell. The wizard focuses on their spell, charging it with full power. During the round, the character rolls their normal dice roll (as if casting the spell) against the CL, which is determined by the length of the charging time. The duration of the character's focus on their spell determines the CL of the spell. If the CL is high, the character can spread it out - but each round must have at least CL 2 (exceptionally 1). Thus, the CL for each charging round of the spell should be 2 (exceptionally 1).

If the character wins the roll (passes the complexity level), the number of wins is recorded. If the roll fails (does not pass the complexity level), nothing happens (0 wins are recorded). In the final charging round, all wins from all rounds are added up into one final total, which will be considered definitive.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, the charging roll can be rolled again in the same round. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** The character must have a talent or specialization. If they have neither, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the spell is quite complex, they roll at a great disadvantage.

###### Regular Attack / Counterattack with Spell - s

Used the same way as a regular [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|attack / counterattack with weapons]].

###### Half Attack / Counterattack with Spell - f

Used the same way as a half [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|attack / counterattack with weapons]].

###### Deflecting Attack with Spell - f

Used the same way as regular deflecting attack with weapons.

##### Morale

Morale affects the enemy's will to fight. Morale is the only attribute that falls under [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]. All maneuvers are performed using skills from this attribute. Another difference is that all maneuvers in the morale category are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]], meaning they do not directly harm the enemy.
