### Cogent Roleplay

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] was created by translating and modifying [Cogent Roleplay](https://cogentroleplay.com/) version 1, written by Josiah Brooks ([Jazza](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHu2KNu6TtJ0p4hpSW7Yv7Q )) and Shad Brooks ([Shadiversity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmMACUKpQeIxN9D9ARli1Q)). So [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] is a project "Powered by Cogent".

If you want, I recommend you to visit Cogent roleplay, or its community version: [CogentRoleplayCommunity Â· GitHub](https://github.com/CogentRoleplayCommunity).
