### Game chronology

Just as every story has a beginning, middle, and end, so does an RPG game. The narrator determines the beginning, middle, and end. The story does not have to start at the beginning; it can start in the middle—for example, when the characters are running from an enraged dragon.

Time in an RPG story flows similarly to a short story or book. It does not have to progress hour by hour or turn by turn. The pace of the story is set by the narrator. The narrator may decide to skip a few weeks or months. Such jumps are made, for example, when the characters are traveling somewhere or during boring passages like a lecture at university. During such a jump, players state what their characters will be doing. If it involves completing something (e.g., an item, training, healing), they roll the appropriate skill for that activity. The number of rolls and the level of difficulty are determined by the narrator.

> [!example]
> The players are traveling on a spaceship. They are attacked by another spaceship. At that point, time moves slowly—turn by turn, with the players deciding what they will do during each turn. Let's say they successfully finish the battle, and the captain decides to head for repairs to a distant spaceport. The journey will take them a month. The narrator asks the players what they will be doing during that month of travel.
> 
> One might engage in research. Another might upgrade their armor. Another might exercise. For these activities, the players roll the appropriate dice to see if they succeeded (how many times they can roll the dice is determined by the narrator).
> 
> The narrator briefly describes what happens during that month on the ship—based on the dice rolls of the players. If necessary, the narrator can create a small scene where the players can talk to another character or get scolded by the boss for messing something up. After summarizing the month-long journey, the narrator tells them they have arrived. And time "slows down" again.

#### Start of the Game

At the beginning of the game, the Narrator introduces their story, which they may have created or based on a movie or video game. They explain what it's about, what genre it is, and might add a short scene or a historical story. The Narrator then describes the rules of the world (is there gravity?), how things work in everyday life (do they travel by balloon? do they only eat vegetables?), in what time the story takes place (medieval times? future?) and what style the story has (steampunk? candyland?). The Narrator also informs the players about the situation affecting the story they are going to play (did the king die and now everyone is fighting for the throne?) and what the players will probably be doing there (main mission? do they have a goal? do they need to eliminate someone?).

At the beginning of the game, players create their characters. They should follow the rules of the world created by the Narrator. However, these characters do not have to fit perfectly into the story or be "custom-made"—for example, if it’s a war, not everyone has to be a professional soldier; they can be ordinary people.

Once the players and the Narrator agree on the characters, the game can begin.

##### Don't know how to create a Story?

If the narrator can't create a story, they can think about a main theme. Something around which the whole story revolves or which might emerge from the story. Then, characters or groups of characters can be created around this theme, with some for it, some against it, and some taking a neutral stance, possibly trying to use it to gain something.

> [!example]
> Cloning, what do the characters say about it, what moral questions could the story address?

If the narrator can't create a world, they can just set some features that will help or hinder the players. If the narrator has "Story Cubes," they can roll them and choose based on the picture that comes up. This way, they can decide on the laws of the world (e.g., gravitational, economic) or even the main theme.

Additionally, the narrator can treat the world as a character with some statistics and talents or spells. Some attributes will have a certain appearance (for example, a world with high STR might be angular, while a world with high REF might be very fast). And the world can either hinder the players (playing against them) or help them (e.g., there's someone else causing trouble, and the world wants to remove them).

Or the narrator can use our tables from the additional chapter. For example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random World\|Random World]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random conflict\|Random Conflict]] alebo [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random World Rules\|Random Rules for the World]].

#### Middle of the Game

The game flows like a story. During it, the narrator tells their story, and the players respond through their characters. They act as if they were actors in a film—which means that if a character has a hot temper, they might "explode" in certain situations, even if it doesn't fit or the player knows it will worsen the situation.

During the game, the narrator gives the players (their characters) tasks and places obstacles in their path that slow down or stop their progress through the story. The players (their characters) respond to these obstacles and try to do something about them by using their skills and talents. To determine if the character succeeded in what they wanted to do, they roll dice. Based on the results, the narrator decides how the story will continue.

#### End of the Game

The game ends when the narrator says so, when the narrator agrees with the players, when the story ends, when the characters complete their mission, or when the characters die or fail their mission.

At the end of each game, there should be a brief summary of everything that happened after the story. It might be helpful to roll for luck to see how the characters will fare going forward. Ending the game, session, or story does not mean the characters' lives end. They, along with their world, can be used in future games. It should be seen as a continuing story. Just as there is Terminator 1, there is also Terminator 2 (the author has no knowledge of any other Terminator movie).
