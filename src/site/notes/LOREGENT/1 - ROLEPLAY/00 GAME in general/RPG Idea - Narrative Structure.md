#### Narrative Structure: 

Stories are broken down into the following parts:

- **Scenes**: like in a play or TV show, this is a single interaction. The main reason to include this part is that we can put rules around scene per scene refresh of mechanics (similar to D&D short rests).
- **Chapter**: typically a single sessions (though some Chapters may spill over multiple sessions), this is a single narrative arc that the Characters face. Chapters should follow the story energy curve (build-up, climax, and resolution).
- **Story-Arc**: This is like a season for a TV show, or an Act in a play. A Story-Arc needs to have a narrative arc that the Characters are progressing towards (fight with the BEG for example). The intent would be that at the end of every Story-Arc, the Characters would gain a Tier (see below).
- **Campaign**: A collection of Story-Arcs that are meant to tie the adventures of the Characters together into a whole story (like a book series).

**Tier Progression**: There are 5 Tiers in the Tier Progression (with an optional starting point for extremely hard Stories). They are New Adventurer (1), Adventurer/One-Shot (2), Veteran (3), Hero (4), and Legend (5). Each Tier grants Character Creation resources, with rules on how to upgrade from one Tier to another.
