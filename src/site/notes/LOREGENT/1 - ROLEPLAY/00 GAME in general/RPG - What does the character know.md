### What does the character know?

The player controls their character in the story and decides what they will do (according to their personality, past, beliefs, and moral compass). However, the player does not need to know everything that their character knows. In such a case, the narrator tells the player to roll the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] skill, and based on the result, the narrator tells the player what they do not know.

On the other hand, the player's character does not know what the player knows. It is forbidden to use knowledge in the game that the player's character has no idea about and has no way of knowing. No actions should be based on this knowledge.

>[!example] 
The players are in a sci-fi story where there are flying cars. They are fleeing from the police and looking for a good car to steal. The player rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill but completely fails. The narrator tells them that they found a car that looks amazing, like a Lamborghini Diablo among flying cars. However, the player knows it's a trap because they failed their dice roll. But this is the player's knowledge, not the character's. Therefore, the player must act as the character would in this situation and get into the car, even though they know it's a trap.

In the event that players are discussing the story among themselves and trying to come up with a plan or solution to a problem, it is important to remember that it is the players who are talking, not their characters. The characters have no knowledge of this plan or solution. Players need to exchange this information as their characters would, in the same style their characters speak. For example, if they use slang or a particular accent or style of speaking, they should use it.

On the other hand, a player's character may know things that the player has no idea about. For example, if they are playing a fantasy story and the player has a character who reads a lot (such as a scholar). If a monster attacks the group, the player can ask if their character has read anything about the monster and if they know of any weaknesses.

- The narrator EITHER says yes and tells everything the character might know.
- OR the skill is rolled - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] - against the difficulty level determined by the narrator (to see if the character remembers). However, if it's a special monster that only a zoologist might know about and the player does not have the relevant talent, the character rolls at [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].    
- OR expertise is rolled (in case the character actually has the talent for zoology). Then the skill - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] - is rolled in combination with the zoology talent, against the difficulty level determined by the narrator.    
- The result will be information that players can use against the monster (for example, that it is afraid of water).
