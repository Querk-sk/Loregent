### What is an RPG? 

RPG (Role Playing Game) is a social game where the narrator tells a story, and players react to that story as fictional characters. The story the narrator tells can be entirely made up or taken from a book, game, or movie. Players decide what their character will do and then roll dice to determine the outcome.

A player plays as their fictional character, just like actors in movies. The player thinks like the character, talks like the character, and does everything in the story that the character would do. So, if a player is playing as an alcoholic character, they will drink a lot of alcohol in the game, even though they may be a teetotaler in real life.

The narrator, on the other hand, creates the story, ensures the RPG rules are followed, and creates obstacles for the players to overcome in the story. Importantly, in our RPG system, there is no single "one true story" that everyone must follow. There's not even a prescribed genre or type. So the story can be whatever the narrator comes up with. Whether it's sci-fi, fantasy, a zombie apocalypse, an epic journey in the style of The Lord of the Rings, or even a single tavern brawl, the narrator has complete freedom in creating the story.

> [!example]
>As for the rules, the Narrator should listen to their players. This isn't a competition about who survivesâ€”it's a "story generator." The Narrator can agree with the players on some modifications, even if they go against the rules of our RPG system, because it is all about agreement and a good story. However, it is necessary to state that the Narrator always has the final word in everything.

#### In short - how it's played

At the beginning of the game, the Narrator tells what will be played and in which world. Then they explain the rules of that world and what it looks like. Based on this, the players create their characters. The Narrator describes the first scene, and the players start saying what their characters will do.

> [!example]
>A post-apocalyptic world that is largely flooded (small buildings are not visible at all, large ones only partially). People live in tall skyscrapers. They have boats, catch fish, grow seaweed, and cultivate remaining crops on rooftops. A player can be a treasure hunter, a fisherman, a member of the skyscraper community, or even a human-fish hybrid who is better off underwater.

In the story, a situation may arise that the players need to respond to, or the players themselves may want to perform an action. In that case, they ask the narrator which skill they should use (or they choose one themselves and ask if they can). The narrator determines the difficulty level of the action. The player rolls dice, with the number of dice rolled being calculated based on the character's attributes and statistics. The number of successes rolled on the dice determines how the story will continue.

> [!example]
> Narrator 
>>You opened the dungeon door, and as you walked down the corridor, you suddenly saw the shadow of a person on the floor. 
>
> Player 
>>Are there any pillars I can hide behind? 
>
>Narrator 
>>Yes, there are pillars along the wall. 
>
>Player 
>>I will hide behind a pillar, in the shadows, so no one can see me. 
>
>Narrator 
>>Roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, difficulty level 2.

The player checks the character sheet to know how many dice they can use for the roll. In this case, it will be 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] + the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill. If the player rolls two or more successes, they successfully hide. Otherwise, they either fail to hide in time or knock into an unlit lamp, causing noise.

>[!note]
>3 dice are added to each roll

#### A note on player-to-player communication with the narrator

Our system is flexible. The Narrator can adjust the rules as needed. Therefore, not all things or possibilities for how the rules should be applied are mentioned here (for example, what damage a sword should deal on a hit, what talents a player is allowed, and so on). This is determined solely by the Narrator and their story. On the other hand, every player can fully use their creativity to create the character they want. Of course, considering the rules set by the Narrator.

> [!example]
>Even if it is a medieval story, the character can be a 'Truck Driver' if it involves a random time traveler or a reincarnated soul (who was a truck driver in their past life).

But everything must ultimately be approved by the Narrator. Therefore, it is necessary for the player to come to an agreement with the Narrator. Not only at the beginning of the game, but also during it. If a player feels they should receive a bonus to their roll, for instance, if they are shooting a bow from a higher position, they can suggest it to the Narrator. The Narrator will then decide whether to grant the player a bonus or not. If the Narrator cannot decide, they can roll dice (if there are multiple options) or flip a coin.

#### The most important rules

- **First most important rule**: Our RPG system is modular. This means that the Narrator can choose which rules to use in their game and which not to. Some rules can be completely ignored, or they can be replaced with ones that fit better.    
- **Second most important rule**: An RPG game is about a good story, good fun, and an overall great experience.
