### Actions

It is an action that a player must or wants to perform. So, they either decide for themselves, or it arises from a situation created by the narrator in the story. An [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Action\|Action]] is performed against something that cannot react, serves as an obstacle or material (for example, cutting down a tree, building a wall, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|swimming]] in water, creating a potion from herbs, learning from a book, and similar activities). Or something that does not want to react (healing wounds, playing a musical instrument, carying someone).

Actions make up the majority of dice rolls (approximately 85%) and are essentially almost every activity one can think of.

A player who wants to perform an action must say what they want to do. Based on that, the challenge level is determined by the narrator, which the player must overcome to succeed. The player must roll the dice for the Skill that logically relates to the action. Based on the result of the roll, the narrator tells the outcome (what happened).

> [!Example] 
> The player wants to swim across a river. The river is calm, and the narrator determines a challenge level of 2 (let's say the character has nothing in their inventory). 
> The player has: 
> - 1 in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 
> - 2 in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] skill 
> - (+) 3 base dice (which are always given) 
> - = 6 dice

The player rolls the dice and depending on the outcome, it will be seen if they succeeded or not.

> [!Example] 
> The player wants to cook a special dinner for guests. It's something complex and difficult to cook. The narrator sets a challenge level of 4. 
> The player has:
> - 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] (the base for the “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]” skill) 
> - 2 points in the “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]” skill 
> - 2 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] cook 
> - (+) 3 base dice (which are always given) 
> - = (8 dice)
