<div style="text-align:center; "><h2>From Author</h2></div>

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] is designed for playing and 'experiencing' various stories. I use it for writing, which hopefully makes my stories at least a bit more original. Because that's the main goal - to write and experience the best stories possible, right?

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] consists of four books. This book you are reading is the RPG System, which deals with the rules of the role-playing game. Another book contains the story universe with planets and worlds where all our stories take place (although the universe is not necessary for your game, it can be an interesting inspiration for you). Another book is dedicated to magic, not only the system but also directly contains magical sciences that you will find in our stories. Finally, there are books that contain modules - stories that you can play directly. And last but not least, books with stories we have written.

It is important for you to know that this [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] project is labeled as 'unstable'. This means that there will be frequent changes. So if you want to use our system to write a series of books or create a major campaign, you might want to wait. However, you can still write a short story or play a micro campaign.

<div style="text-align:center; "><h2>Thanks</h2></div>

### Cogent Roleplay

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] was created by translating and modifying [Cogent Roleplay](https://cogentroleplay.com/) version 1, written by Josiah Brooks ([Jazza](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHu2KNu6TtJ0p4hpSW7Yv7Q )) and Shad Brooks ([Shadiversity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmMACUKpQeIxN9D9ARli1Q)). So [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] is a project "Powered by Cogent".

### What is an RPG? 

RPG (Role Playing Game) is a social game where the narrator tells a story, and players react to that story as fictional characters. The story the narrator tells can be entirely made up or taken from a book, game, or movie. Players decide what their character will do and then roll dice to determine the outcome.

A player plays as their fictional character, just like actors in movies. The player thinks like the character, talks like the character, and does everything in the story that the character would do. So, if a player is playing as an alcoholic character, they will drink a lot of alcohol in the game, even though they may be a teetotaler in real life.

The narrator, on the other hand, creates the story, ensures the RPG rules are followed, and creates obstacles for the players to overcome in the story. Importantly, in our RPG system, there is no single "one true story" that everyone must follow. There's not even a prescribed genre or type. So the story can be whatever the narrator comes up with. Whether it's sci-fi, fantasy, a zombie apocalypse, an epic journey in the style of The Lord of the Rings, or even a single tavern brawl, the narrator has complete freedom in creating the story.

> [!example]
>As for the rules, the Narrator should listen to their players. This isn't a competition about who survives—it's a "story generator." The Narrator can agree with the players on some modifications, even if they go against the rules of our RPG system, because it is all about agreement and a good story. However, it is necessary to state that the Narrator always has the final word in everything.

#### In short - how it's played

At the beginning of the game, the Narrator tells what will be played and in which world. Then they explain the rules of that world and what it looks like. Based on this, the players create their characters. The Narrator describes the first scene, and the players start saying what their characters will do.

> [!example]
>A post-apocalyptic world that is largely flooded (small buildings are not visible at all, large ones only partially). People live in tall skyscrapers. They have boats, catch fish, grow seaweed, and cultivate remaining crops on rooftops. A player can be a treasure hunter, a fisherman, a member of the skyscraper community, or even a human-fish hybrid who is better off underwater.

In the story, a situation may arise that the players need to respond to, or the players themselves may want to perform an action. In that case, they ask the narrator which skill they should use (or they choose one themselves and ask if they can). The narrator determines the difficulty level of the action. The player rolls dice, with the number of dice rolled being calculated based on the character's attributes and statistics. The number of successes rolled on the dice determines how the story will continue.

> [!example] Príklad z hrania
> Narrator 
>>You opened the dungeon door, and as you walked down the corridor, you suddenly saw the shadow of a person on the floor. 
>
> Player 
>>Are there any pillars I can hide behind? 
>
>Narrator 
>>Yes, there are pillars along the wall. 
>
>Player 
>>I will hide behind a pillar, in the shadows, so no one can see me. 
>
>Narrator 
>>Roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, difficulty level 2.

The player checks the character sheet to know how many dice they can use for the roll. In this case, it will be 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] + the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill. If the player rolls two or more successes, they successfully hide. Otherwise, they either fail to hide in time or knock into an unlit lamp, causing noise.

>[!note]
>3 dice are added to each roll

#### A note on player-to-player communication with the narrator

Our system is flexible. The Narrator can adjust the rules as needed. Therefore, not all things or possibilities for how the rules should be applied are mentioned here (for example, what damage a sword should deal on a hit, what talents a player is allowed, and so on). This is determined solely by the Narrator and their story. On the other hand, every player can fully use their creativity to create the character they want. Of course, considering the rules set by the Narrator.

> [!example]
>Even if it is a medieval story, the character can be a 'Truck Driver' if it involves a random time traveler or a reincarnated soul (who was a truck driver in their past life).

But everything must ultimately be approved by the Narrator. Therefore, it is necessary for the player to come to an agreement with the Narrator. Not only at the beginning of the game, but also during it. If a player feels they should receive a bonus to their roll, for instance, if they are shooting a bow from a higher position, they can suggest it to the Narrator. The Narrator will then decide whether to grant the player a bonus or not. If the Narrator cannot decide, they can roll dice (if there are multiple options) or flip a coin.

#### The most important rules

- **First most important rule**: Our RPG system is modular. This means that the Narrator can choose which rules to use in their game and which not to. Some rules can be completely ignored, or they can be replaced with ones that fit better.    
- **Second most important rule**: An RPG game is about a good story, good fun, and an overall great experience.

### Game chronology

Just as every story has a beginning, middle, and end, so does an RPG game. The narrator determines the beginning, middle, and end. The story does not have to start at the beginning; it can start in the middle—for example, when the characters are running from an enraged dragon.

Time in an RPG story flows similarly to a short story or book. It does not have to progress hour by hour or turn by turn. The pace of the story is set by the narrator. The narrator may decide to skip a few weeks or months. Such jumps are made, for example, when the characters are traveling somewhere or during boring passages like a lecture at university. During such a jump, players state what their characters will be doing. If it involves completing something (e.g., an item, training, healing), they roll the appropriate skill for that activity. The number of rolls and the level of difficulty are determined by the narrator.

> [!example]
> The players are traveling on a spaceship. They are attacked by another spaceship. At that point, time moves slowly—turn by turn, with the players deciding what they will do during each turn. Let's say they successfully finish the battle, and the captain decides to head for repairs to a distant spaceport. The journey will take them a month. The narrator asks the players what they will be doing during that month of travel.
> 
> One might engage in research. Another might upgrade their armor. Another might exercise. For these activities, the players roll the appropriate dice to see if they succeeded (how many times they can roll the dice is determined by the narrator).
> 
> The narrator briefly describes what happens during that month on the ship—based on the dice rolls of the players. If necessary, the narrator can create a small scene where the players can talk to another character or get scolded by the boss for messing something up. After summarizing the month-long journey, the narrator tells them they have arrived. And time "slows down" again.

#### Start of the Game

At the beginning of the game, the Narrator introduces their story, which they may have created or based on a movie or video game. They explain what it's about, what genre it is, and might add a short scene or a historical story. The Narrator then describes the rules of the world (is there gravity?), how things work in everyday life (do they travel by balloon? do they only eat vegetables?), in what time the story takes place (medieval times? future?) and what style the story has (steampunk? candyland?). The Narrator also informs the players about the situation affecting the story they are going to play (did the king die and now everyone is fighting for the throne?) and what the players will probably be doing there (main mission? do they have a goal? do they need to eliminate someone?).

At the beginning of the game, players create their characters. They should follow the rules of the world created by the Narrator. However, these characters do not have to fit perfectly into the story or be "custom-made"—for example, if it’s a war, not everyone has to be a professional soldier; they can be ordinary people.

Once the players and the Narrator agree on the characters, the game can begin.

##### Don't know how to create a Story?

If the narrator can't create a story, they can think about a main theme. Something around which the whole story revolves or which might emerge from the story. Then, characters or groups of characters can be created around this theme, with some for it, some against it, and some taking a neutral stance, possibly trying to use it to gain something.

> [!example]
> Cloning, what do the characters say about it, what moral questions could the story address?

If the narrator can't create a world, they can just set some features that will help or hinder the players. If the narrator has "Story Cubes," they can roll them and choose based on the picture that comes up. This way, they can decide on the laws of the world (e.g., gravitational, economic) or even the main theme.

Additionally, the narrator can treat the world as a character with some statistics and talents or spells. Some attributes will have a certain appearance (for example, a world with high STR might be angular, while a world with high REF might be very fast). And the world can either hinder the players (playing against them) or help them (e.g., there's someone else causing trouble, and the world wants to remove them).

Or the narrator can use our tables from the additional chapter. For example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random World\|Random World]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random conflict\|Random Conflict]] alebo [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random World Rules\|Random Rules for the World]].

#### Middle of the Game

The game flows like a story. During it, the narrator tells their story, and the players respond through their characters. They act as if they were actors in a film—which means that if a character has a hot temper, they might "explode" in certain situations, even if it doesn't fit or the player knows it will worsen the situation.

During the game, the narrator gives the players (their characters) tasks and places obstacles in their path that slow down or stop their progress through the story. The players (their characters) respond to these obstacles and try to do something about them by using their skills and talents. To determine if the character succeeded in what they wanted to do, they roll dice. Based on the results, the narrator decides how the story will continue.

#### End of the Game

The game ends when the narrator says so, when the narrator agrees with the players, when the story ends, when the characters complete their mission, or when the characters die or fail their mission.

At the end of each game, there should be a brief summary of everything that happened after the story. It might be helpful to roll for luck to see how the characters will fare going forward. Ending the game, session, or story does not mean the characters' lives end. They, along with their world, can be used in future games. It should be seen as a continuing story. Just as there is Terminator 1, there is also Terminator 2 (the author has no knowledge of any other Terminator movie).

### Traveling

In every story, characters travel from one place to another. To make this traveling not boring, our RPG system does not use realistic traveling (where the exact distance characters travel is measured), but rather narrative traveling, where the distance is determined by the number of events or problems that the characters experience or need to solve.

#### Distance

Travel distance falls into three categories:

- Close    
- Farther    
- Very Far    

The storyteller does not need to think much about how many kilometers the characters need to travel. It is enough to decide between the three options (listed above). However, if the storyteller wants to determine the distance exactly, they can use the following list as a reference.

### Other Challenge Levels

In this section, there are lists of challenge levels for variables such as distance, height, depth, weight, time, and so on. These lists serve as a guide for the Narrator when they want to determine the challenge level of a journey (when characters are traveling somewhere), the challenge level of a spell (for instance, when a character wants to lift a car with their magic), or the challenge level when characters encounter some danger and need to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|solve the situation quickly]].

#### Narrative distance between two places

This challenge level is used when characters are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Traveling\|traveling]] somewhere, and the Narrator wants to determine how long they will travel or how many events they will experience along the way. It can also be used when they are in a hurry (for instance, when the villain wants to activate a superweapon, and the characters want to stop them) to see if they can make it in time, or when a character is sneaking past guards to see if they go unnoticed.

The narrative distance increases the base challenge level of the character, changes the challenge level for the enemy, or changes the number of rounds during which the enemy can roll dice (for example, the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill when searching for the character).

Below is a list written in kilometers, but it can also be used for other distance units. So, for example, when determining a spaceship jump, it won't be calculated in kilometers but in light-years. And when a character floats in a space station and pushes off with their legs (to travel a distance, for example, from the bridge to the laboratory), it will be calculated in meters, not kilometers.

As for skills, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] is used to overcome distances (if the character is on foot), or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (if they are driving a car), but other skills can also be used as determined by the Narrator (for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] when jumping in a space station or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] when swimming across a river).

##### List of distances

1. Distance 0,5 Km || (15 minutes )
2. Distance 1 Km ||  (30 minutes)
3. Distance 5 Km ||  (1 hours)
4. Distance 10 Km ||  (2 hours)
5. Distance 50 Km || (10 hours)
6. Distance 100 Km || (20 hours)
7. Distance 500 Km || (4 days)
8. Distance 1 000 Km || (8 days)
9. Distance 5 000 Km || (1,5 months)
10. Distance 10 000 Km || (~3 months)
11. Distance 20 000 Km ||  (~6 months)

>[!note]
>- The time written for distances is the time it takes for a person to cover that distance. According to the internet, the walking speed of a person is approximately 5 km per hour.

##### Distance, car and shoes

Objects or machines that accelerate or somehow facilitate movement, reduce the challenge level when covering distances. The exact amount by which they reduce the challenge is determined by the Narrator, as each machine has different movement capabilities.

>[!example]
>
> * Magic Boots of Speed ​​= (minus) 1 ZL
> * Bicycle = (minus) 2 ZL
> * Car = (minus) 3 ZL
> * Single-seat plane = (minus) 6 ZL

The challenge of covering distances is also influenced by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Size of the character\|size of the character]]

##### Distance, terrain, and circumstances

When it comes to distance (whether narrative or combat), the success of overcoming it is influenced by circumstances such as terrain complexity, gravity strength, or thin air.

>[!example] 
>- A strong snowstorm can add a CL +2.
>- A high mountain can add a CL +4

Movement circumstances (whether terrain or weather, and so on) can be applied at any time and as needed. Sometimes the circumstance is so strong that before the main roll, the character must also make a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|skill check]] of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill. For instance, when they are in deep water or flying in low gravity.

##### Change in Movement Speed

The final challenge level (derived from distance) can also change based on how fast the character is moving. For example, when a character is rushing to overtake someone (say, in a race), or when they are slowly sneaking through a garden to avoid guards.

Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Slower movement has the advantage of the character moving much more quietly, but on the other hand, it takes longer. The advantage is that the character's challenge level decreases (for example, when walking through dry leaves), while the disadvantage is that the guards will roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] multiple times in a row. This time disadvantage, however, breaks the rules. Because on one hand, it decreases the challenge level derived from the distance, which on the other hand "kind of" speeds up the character's movement through the terrain - since the challenge level also indicates how quickly the character moves through a given section (for example, at challenge 4 it is about 2 hours, or 4 rounds of rolling dice). So what should the Narrator do?

Well, when a character moves slower, the challenge level decreases when solving problems (i.e., when rolling skills). However, the time is extended. If a character, for example, reduces the challenge by 2 (by moving slowly), their time is extended by 2. So, for a distance of 3, they will have challenges with CL 1, but it will extend their time to 5 ( 10 hours, or 5 rounds of rolling dice ).

* Slowly
	- Description:
		- The character moves slowly, carefully, or quietly.        
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 2 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 2.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance increases by +2.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +2 extra dice rolls.

- Slower    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves slower, more carefully, or more quietly.
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 1 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 1 success, or the CL for the enemy increases by 1.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance increases by +1.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +1 extra dice roll.

- Normal    
	- No changes

- Faster    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves a bit faster, more recklessly, or noisier.
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 1 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 1 success, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 1.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance decreases by 1.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 1 fewer dice roll.

- Even faster    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves even faster, more recklessly, or noisier.     
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 2 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 2.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance decreases by 2.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 2 fewer dice rolls.

>[!example]
The character is sneaking down a corridor with guards. However, they are in a great hurry because the enemy will activate their superweapon in 3 rounds.
>
The character decides to go 'even faster.' Thanks to this, they will overtake the enemy, but on the other hand, the guards may detect the character sooner because, to detect them, they need to overcome a much lower challenge level in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|perception]] rolls.
>
(In this case, it can be that the character rolls [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] and rolls 4 successes. This becomes the challenge level for the guards. They will roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] – but because the character is in a hurry, they only need to overcome CL 2 instead of CL 4.)

#### Narrative Height

Narrative height refers to the height that a character must overcome when jumping somewhere. Narrative height also includes depth when a character is falling from some height. It can also refer to the depth of the sea when a character is swimming in an underwater cave. It can also refer to flight altitude when a character is flying in an airplane. We have summarized all these cases in the following lists, assigning a challenge level to each height (or depth). The lists use challenge levels that have already been adjusted to account for normal human abilities.

However, if a height in the story is not a whole number (e.g., 4.2 m), the number is rounded "up" to determine the challenge level (in the case of 4.2 m, it will be 5 m).

##### Narrative Height

This list of challenges accounts for **jumping up** (when a character jumps somewhere), **jumping down** (when a character jumps into a pit), or even **leaping over** (when a character jumps across a chasm).

1. Height 2 m
2. Height 4 m
3. Height 8 m
4. Height 16 m
5. Height 32 m
6. Height 64 m
7. Height 128 m
8. Height 256 m
9. Height 512 m

##### Narrative Height (flying an airplane)

If a character is flying an airplane (and so on), they need to fly at a certain height above the ground to avoid crashing into a tower or tree. Therefore, the lower they fly (for instance, to avoid radar), the more challenging it will be for them to maneuver without crashing. The list below assumes a character flying a typical light airplane. Therefore, if the character in the story is flying something heavier, the Narrator should adjust this scale accordingly. The heavier the airplane, the higher the challenge at lower altitudes.

1. Height 512 m
2. Height 256 m
3. Height 128 m
4. Height 64 m
5. Height 32 m
6. Height 16 m
7. Height 8 m
8. Height 4 m
9. Height 2 m
10. Height 1 m
11. Height approximately 0 m

##### Narrative Depth

When a character swims in the sea, they swim at a certain depth. The deeper they dive, the more difficult swimming becomes due to increased water pressure and currents that are not present at shallower depths. The scale below reflects this challenge, accounting for a typical character swimming with regular diving equipment. However, if a character is swimming in a submarine (or something that protects them from pressure), like with distances, the machine subtracts some value from the challenge (for example, a personal submarine CL - 8).

1. Depth 2 m
2. Depth 4 m
3. Depth 8 m
4. Depth 16 m
5. Depth 32 m
6. Depth 64 m
7. Depth 128 m
8. Depth 256 m
9. Depth 512 m

#### Narrative Weight

It is used when characters want to lift something or someone, move something, push something. Simply put, they have to exert effort against some weight. Narrative weight has nothing to do with the character's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Inventory\|inventory]] (and the items in it).

Secondly, the challenge of narrative weight is relative. It will be determined differently, for example, in a world full of giants or in an ant world. Therefore, the Narrator must adjust this list (below) according to the story. The lists use challenge levels that have already been adjusted to account for normal human abilities.

0. wt. 5 Kg. (e.g., newborn, vacuum cleaner, watermelon)
1. wt. 10 Kg. (e.g., child, bucket of paint, tire)
2. wt. 20 Kg. (e.g., large bucket of paint, leopard, dumbbells)
3. wt. 40 Kg. (e.g., toilet, washing machine)
4. wt. 80 Kg. (e.g., baby elephant, bags of cement)
5. wt. 160 Kg. (e.g., refrigerator, large piano)
6. wt. 320 Kg. (e.g., deer, compressor, trailer)
7. wt. 640 Kg. (e.g., seven refrigerators, camel)
8. wt. 1 t. (e.g., car, minibus, medium-sized boat)
9. wt. 3 t. (e.g., rhinoceros, small truck, jeep)
10. wt. 5 t. (e.g., tank)
11. wt. 10 t
12. wt. 20 t
13. wt. 41 t
14. wt. 82 t
15. wt. 164 t
16. wt. 328 t
17. wt. 655 t
18. wt. 1 K.t
19. wt. 3 K.t
20. wt. 5 K.t

[Weight of Stuff – We like to weigh stuff so you don't have to](https://weightofstuff.com/)

- ton = 1000 kg
- kilo ton = 1000 t    
- mega ton = 1 million t    
- giga ton = 1 billion t

The challenge level from weight is reduced by objects or machines designed for lifting. The exact reduction must be determined by the Narrator, as each machine has different capabilities. (The list below includes machines or objects that operate in kilograms).

* Magic strength gloves = (minus) 1 CL
* Furniture moving straps = (minus) 2 CL
* Forklift = (minus) 7 CL
* Small crane = (minus) 10 CL

#### Timing of skills

It is used in the story when characters want to lift something and hold it for a certain time (for example, a burning coal, which is part of a courage ritual), or used for spells, for example when a character summons an elemental with a short lifespan.

##### Challenge level and time

0. Minute
1. 30 minutes
2. Hour
3. 12 hours
4. Day
5. 4 days
6. Week
7. 2 weeks
8. Month
9. 3 months
10. Half a year
11. Year
12. Two years
13. Five years
14. Ten years
15. Twenty years
16. etc.

##### CL, Time, and Speeding Up or Slowing Down

When a character needs to, they can speed up their action (e.g., disarming a bomb when there's no time, so they must hurry). Or when doing something complicated and wanting to concentrate - they can "slow down" their action. It's the same rule as with distances and movement speed, just slightly adjusted. Mainly in that for the required time to perform an action, the challenge list from the time is used (as shown above).

- Slowly    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action slowly, carefully, or quietly.   
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 2 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 2.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action increases by +2 (e.g., instead of 1 hour, it will take 1 day).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +2 extra dice rolls.

- Slower    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action slower, more carefully, or more quietly.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 1 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 1.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action increases by +1 (e.g., instead of 1 hour, it will take a few hours).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +1 extra dice roll.

- Normal    
    - No changes

- Faster    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action a bit faster, more recklessly, or noisier.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 1 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 1 success, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 1.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action decreases by 1 (e.g., instead of 1 day, it will take a few hours).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 1 fewer dice roll.

- Even Faster    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action even faster, more recklessly, or noisier.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 2 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 2.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action decreases by 2 (e.g., instead of 1 day, it will take an hour).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 2 fewer dice rolls.

Distance only indicates how many events a character (or their entire group) experiences during travel. The number of events can be determined simply or more complexly. The group completes the entire distance once they experience (or solve) all the events that travel brings.

##### Simple Determination of Number of Events

- Close - 1 event    
- Farther - 2 events    
- Very Far - 3 events

##### Complex Determination of Number of Events

When the storyteller uses the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels#List of distances\|distance list]], the number of events the characters experience on the journey can be determined according to this list. The complexity level based on distance can then be used as a number to determine the complexity of all events during the journey. Alternatively, this number can be used to determine the number of event rolls according to the table of randomness. Everything is explained below.

###### Challenge level of Events

The challenge level (CL) based on distance determines the complexity of all events the characters encounter during the journey. This means that if the CL is 6, then the CL of one event will also be 6. However, the storyteller can divide this number into multiple events, for example, the characters experience 3 events, each with a CL of 2.

###### Number of Events

The CL based on distance determines the total number of events the characters encounter during the journey. This means that if the CL is 6, then the number of event rolls according to the tables of randomness will be 6. So the storyteller rolls the dice 6 times and chooses an event according to the tables. They can choose from the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter#Náhodné stretnutie\|random encounters]], a random task according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random conflict#Náhodný konflikt\|random conflicts]], or from the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Story cubes#Príbehové kocky\|story dice]]. They can also determine the weather according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Weather#Náhodné počasie\|random weather]] or the properties of the terrain according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random World#Náhodný svet\|random world]].

##### Note on Number of Events

The storyteller does not need to stick strictly to any numbers during journey planning. If they decide that nothing significant happened during the journey, that is fine. Or if they decide that instead of 6 smaller events, there will be one side quest - that is also fine. The storyteller has complete freedom in how many events to include in the journey and how significant they should be.

#### Types of Events

Each event falls into three categories:

- Combat Event    
- Story Event    
- Exploration Event    
- Mixed Events, which combine the previous ones    
- and Rest Event

##### Combat Event

Combat events may or may not be important for the story. Characters can fight against bandits, animals, or even living plants. It's a good opportunity for the storyteller to show what kinds of monsters exist in the world or what types of dangerous groups there are.

Things in combat events are resolved only through combat or some type of duel.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters has attracted the attention of the main villain, who sent some minions to test their strength.
>- The group of characters encounters someone they have taken money from.
>- The group of characters notices marks on the trees. However, they don't know that this territory belongs to monsters who attack the group because they ignored the warning (not noticing the marks).
>- The characters arrive in a village where the main lord is bored. So the lord organizes a race with obstacles (and monsters).

##### Story Event

In story events, roles are played as if in a theater play. Characters can encounter another character who talks to them and tells them something. Characters can get into negotiations with an enemy or attend a celebration.

Things in story events are mainly resolved through dialogue or by solving puzzles, problems, or mysteries.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters encounters a group of wandering musicians who travel the world and play wherever they are paid. They can exchange stories and important advice.
>- The group of characters comes across a golden carriage guarded by strong knights.
>- It seems that the group of characters has entered a territory where the ghosts of the deceased cannot, well, die, and they remain in this world. The same fate could befall the group unless they solve their problem.
>- The characters find a discreet shop where all items are obviously quite expensive and powerful. But when they ask for the price, the shopkeeper says they'll sell it for "a small favor."

##### Exploration Event

Exploration events reveal more about the place or the overall land where the characters are. They are not in any danger from enemies – the characters need to use their eyes and ears (and sometimes their wits).

Things in exploration events are resolved by being observant, walking, finding a path, with the main enemy being the place itself.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters comes to a deep chasm. A rickety bridge leads across it. How will they cross the bridge? Will they go another way?
>- Millennia ago, wizards split the seas to allow people to pass between two islands, but it seems that this ancient magic is fading, and there are random currents of water from the sea walls. How will they cross this path to survive?
>- What seemed like a normal mountain is actually moving. It turns out to be the back of a giant turtle. The entire forest shakes and trembles as this huge beast moves. The characters must flee, but how and where?
>- The group of characters finds an old battlefield where a great battle once took place. What will they find there?
>- The group of characters passes through a field of magical plants that emit hallucinogenic drugs. The characters' nightmares become reality. What must they do to escape?

##### Mixed Events

Sometimes the storyteller may not be able to choose between the offered options and therefore can combine events.

Mixed events are events that blend several categories, either because they can change from one to another, or because they exhibit traits of both categories simultaneously.

>[!example]
>- (Combat and Story): The group of characters came to fight an evil witch who had killed many villagers. The witch says they can make a deal – if they let her go, she will give them an item that will greatly help them on their journey. If they fight, they will lose this item. This event starts as a story and can turn into a combat event, depending on how the parties negotiate.
>- (Exploration and Story): While exploring an abandoned mine, the group meets a small creature that seems lost. The creature is extremely cautious and scared of the group. But over time, they manage to befriend it. Once they are friends, the creature helps them pass through a dark cave. This event starts as exploration, continues as a story, and ends as exploration.
>- (Exploration and Combat): The group must find three items that bind ancient spirits to an abandoned mansion. They must destroy these items while the spirits attack and trouble them. This event is both exploration and combat.
>- (Exploration, Combat, and Story): The main villain has kidnapped an important character and plans to perform a ritual in their fortress. The characters can try to negotiate with the villain, attack directly, or infiltrate the fortress and quietly free their friend. The choice is theirs.

##### Rest Event

Rest events are when characters simply rest at a camp. During this rest, they can eat, heal their wounds, but they can also train their skills, weapon handling, or spells. In addition, they can engage in other activities, such as studying a mysterious book they have.

For longer journeys, it is recommended to give the characters at least one rest (one dice roll – for example, for regeneration or training, etc.)

### What does the character know?

The player controls their character in the story and decides what they will do (according to their personality, past, beliefs, and moral compass). However, the player does not need to know everything that their character knows. In such a case, the narrator tells the player to roll the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] skill, and based on the result, the narrator tells the player what they do not know.

On the other hand, the player's character does not know what the player knows. It is forbidden to use knowledge in the game that the player's character has no idea about and has no way of knowing. No actions should be based on this knowledge.

>[!example] 
The players are in a sci-fi story where there are flying cars. They are fleeing from the police and looking for a good car to steal. The player rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill but completely fails. The narrator tells them that they found a car that looks amazing, like a Lamborghini Diablo among flying cars. However, the player knows it's a trap because they failed their dice roll. But this is the player's knowledge, not the character's. Therefore, the player must act as the character would in this situation and get into the car, even though they know it's a trap.

In the event that players are discussing the story among themselves and trying to come up with a plan or solution to a problem, it is important to remember that it is the players who are talking, not their characters. The characters have no knowledge of this plan or solution. Players need to exchange this information as their characters would, in the same style their characters speak. For example, if they use slang or a particular accent or style of speaking, they should use it.

On the other hand, a player's character may know things that the player has no idea about. For example, if they are playing a fantasy story and the player has a character who reads a lot (such as a scholar). If a monster attacks the group, the player can ask if their character has read anything about the monster and if they know of any weaknesses.

- The narrator EITHER says yes and tells everything the character might know.
- OR the skill is rolled - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] - against the difficulty level determined by the narrator (to see if the character remembers). However, if it's a special monster that only a zoologist might know about and the player does not have the relevant talent, the character rolls at [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].    
- OR expertise is rolled (in case the character actually has the talent for zoology). Then the skill - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] - is rolled in combination with the zoology talent, against the difficulty level determined by the narrator.    
- The result will be information that players can use against the monster (for example, that it is afraid of water).

### Actions

It is an action that a player must or wants to perform. So, they either decide for themselves, or it arises from a situation created by the narrator in the story. An [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Action\|Action]] is performed against something that cannot react, serves as an obstacle or material (for example, cutting down a tree, building a wall, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|swimming]] in water, creating a potion from herbs, learning from a book, and similar activities). Or something that does not want to react (healing wounds, playing a musical instrument, carying someone).

Actions make up the majority of dice rolls (approximately 85%) and are essentially almost every activity one can think of.

A player who wants to perform an action must say what they want to do. Based on that, the challenge level is determined by the narrator, which the player must overcome to succeed. The player must roll the dice for the Skill that logically relates to the action. Based on the result of the roll, the narrator tells the outcome (what happened).

> [!Example] 
> The player wants to swim across a river. The river is calm, and the narrator determines a challenge level of 2 (let's say the character has nothing in their inventory). 
> The player has: 
> - 1 in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 
> - 2 in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] skill 
> - (+) 3 base dice (which are always given) 
> - = 6 dice

The player rolls the dice and depending on the outcome, it will be seen if they succeeded or not.

> [!Example] 
> The player wants to cook a special dinner for guests. It's something complex and difficult to cook. The narrator sets a challenge level of 4. 
> The player has:
> - 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] (the base for the “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]” skill) 
> - 2 points in the “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]” skill 
> - 2 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] cook 
> - (+) 3 base dice (which are always given) 
> - = (8 dice)

### Conflict

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Conflict\|Conflict]] is sort of a battle. It arises when one character decides to perform an action against another character or against something that can actively react. This could be, for example, a sword fight, arm-wrestling, lying, or sneaking (when a character wants to secretly approach someone). Both characters involved in the conflict must roll the same skill that the conflict concerns.

> [!example]
> The characters are arm-wrestling in the tavern. The skill involved is [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]].
> - Character 1 has 1 in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] and 2 in the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] (6 dice).
> - Character 2 has 0 in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] and 1 in the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] (4 dice).
> - Both characters roll dice.
> - The character who rolls more successes wins the conflict and wins the wrestle competition.

Conflicts are divided into [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/passive conflict\|passive]] based on whether the character involved is aware of the conflict or not.

##### Active Conflict

It is an action against a character who is aware of the conflict. This could be, for example, arm-wrestling, competition, running away, negotiating with a merchant about the price, and so on. When characters roll dice and get the same number of successes, they must roll again.

> [!example]
> The characters are arm-wrestling in the tavern. The skill involved is [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]].
> - Character 1 rolled 3 successes
> - Character 2 rolled 3 successes
> - They roll again until someone wins the roll.

##### Passive Conflict

It is an action against a character who is completely unaware of the conflict. This could be, for example, lying, seducing, persuading, sneaking, and so on. When characters roll dice and get the same number of successes, the passive character (the victim) wins the conflict.

> [!example]
> Lying to a merchant
> - A character wants to deceive the merchant that their item is extremely rare.
> - Character 1 rolls 6 dice. 3 + 1 from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + 2 from the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]
> - The merchant rolls 6 dice. 3 + 0 from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + 3 from the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]
> - ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] is used as a defense against the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]], but any other skill from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] can be used)
><br>
> - Character 1 and the merchant roll dice
> - Character 1 rolled 4 successes
> - The merchant rolled 4 successes
> - The merchant wins the conflict.
><br>
> -  The merchant wins because he is just listening.
> - The character is active because they are thinking about how to deceive the merchant and therefore speaking.
> - The character must change the merchant's opinion. The merchant already has his opinion.

### Challenge Level
(also referred to as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]])

When a character decides to do something in the story, the narrator assigns a so-called [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]]. The character must overcome this level for the activity to be successful. The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]] can be overcome by rolling dice.

> [!example]
> - The character escapes from prison and encounters a window with bars.
> - The player says they want to cut through the bars.
> - The narrator determines the difficulty level that must be overcome. Let's say they have a iron file, so the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] will be 3.
> - The player then rolls dice, and based on the result, the narrator decides whether the character managed to cut through the bars or not.

The challenge level is determined based on the difficulty of the activity the character is attempting. The more difficult the task, the higher the challenge level the character must overcome for the activity to be successful. If the narrator is unsure how to determine it precisely, they just need to imagine how an average person from that world would perform the task (or the narrator themselves, if they were in a similar situation). The narrator might think about assigning a higher or lower challenge level to a character with higher or lower attributes, but this should not be done. These things are resolved by dice and attribute points. The challenge level is determined in each game in the same way - as for an average person from that world.

> [!example]
> - The player's character and another random character are having a contest to see who can lift a large stone weighing 100 kg.
> - The player's character has a strength of 4 ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 4),
> - The other character is an average person with a strength of 0 ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 0).
> - Both have the same [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]], for example, 4. 
> - The winner will be decided by rolling dice.

The only thing that can change the challenge level is the circumstances in which the activity is performed.

> [!example]
> - The player's character ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2) wants to lift a car off the ground.
> - That's a challenge level of 4.
> - But it's in low gravity, say 3 times less than Earth's gravity.
> - This changes the challenge level to 2 because the circumstances are different.

This is a list of challenge levels and possible examples of what each number or level represents :

0. Easy activity (( Something that can be done very quickly and very easily ))
1. Common activity (( Something we do regularly, but it requires effort ))
2. Uncommon activity (( Something we do rarely, and it requires effort ))
3. Specialized activity (( This requires education ))
4. Hard activity (( This is really hard to do ))
5. Very hard activity (( This requires a lot of effort ))
6. Extremely hard activity (( Very few people can do this ))
7. Hardly imaginable activity (( This can't be done. Maybe in 1% of cases ))
8. Barely manageable activity (( This can't be done. Maybe in 0.5% of cases ))
9. Almost unachievable activity (( This is almost impossible to do ))
10. Unachievable activity (( This is really impossible to do ))

Another possible example of a challenge level :

1. Climb up normal stairs
2. Climb up slippery stairs (stairs have oil on their surface)
3. Climb up slippery stairs while holding a heavy chest
4. Climb up crumbling stairs (e.g., in an old tomb)"

#### Scalable Challenge Level

Sometimes in a story, it may not be possible to precisely determine the challenge of the activity the characters want to perform. In such cases, the narrator can ask the player to roll dice to determine their skill, and based on the result, the narrator will announce the outcome. A failure is considered when the player rolls no successes at all.

> [!example]
> The characters passed through a galactic gate to a completely unknown place. The narrator asked them to roll for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|perception]].
> 
> Character 1 rolled 3 successes.
> Character 2 rolled 1 success.
> Character 3 rolled 6 successes.
> Character 4 rolled 0 successes.
> 
> The narrator can say that Character 4's vision is still "unclean" and they are blinded after passing through the gate, so they see nothing. Characters 2 and 1 saw that they are in some room with old objects. Character 3 saw that they are in something resembling an old museum filled with artifacts, although the whole room looks terribly abandoned (because there is a lot of dust and cobwebs).

### Other Challenge Levels

In this section, there are lists of challenge levels for variables such as distance, height, depth, weight, time, and so on. These lists serve as a guide for the Narrator when they want to determine the challenge level of a journey (when characters are traveling somewhere), the challenge level of a spell (for instance, when a character wants to lift a car with their magic), or the challenge level when characters encounter some danger and need to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|solve the situation quickly]].

#### Narrative distance between two places

This challenge level is used when characters are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Traveling\|traveling]] somewhere, and the Narrator wants to determine how long they will travel or how many events they will experience along the way. It can also be used when they are in a hurry (for instance, when the villain wants to activate a superweapon, and the characters want to stop them) to see if they can make it in time, or when a character is sneaking past guards to see if they go unnoticed.

The narrative distance increases the base challenge level of the character, changes the challenge level for the enemy, or changes the number of rounds during which the enemy can roll dice (for example, the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill when searching for the character).

Below is a list written in kilometers, but it can also be used for other distance units. So, for example, when determining a spaceship jump, it won't be calculated in kilometers but in light-years. And when a character floats in a space station and pushes off with their legs (to travel a distance, for example, from the bridge to the laboratory), it will be calculated in meters, not kilometers.

As for skills, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] is used to overcome distances (if the character is on foot), or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (if they are driving a car), but other skills can also be used as determined by the Narrator (for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] when jumping in a space station or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] when swimming across a river).

##### List of distances

1. Distance 0,5 Km || (15 minutes )
2. Distance 1 Km ||  (30 minutes)
3. Distance 5 Km ||  (1 hours)
4. Distance 10 Km ||  (2 hours)
5. Distance 50 Km || (10 hours)
6. Distance 100 Km || (20 hours)
7. Distance 500 Km || (4 days)
8. Distance 1 000 Km || (8 days)
9. Distance 5 000 Km || (1,5 months)
10. Distance 10 000 Km || (~3 months)
11. Distance 20 000 Km ||  (~6 months)

>[!note]
>- The time written for distances is the time it takes for a person to cover that distance. According to the internet, the walking speed of a person is approximately 5 km per hour.

##### Distance, car and shoes

Objects or machines that accelerate or somehow facilitate movement, reduce the challenge level when covering distances. The exact amount by which they reduce the challenge is determined by the Narrator, as each machine has different movement capabilities.

>[!example]
>
> * Magic Boots of Speed ​​= (minus) 1 ZL
> * Bicycle = (minus) 2 ZL
> * Car = (minus) 3 ZL
> * Single-seat plane = (minus) 6 ZL

The challenge of covering distances is also influenced by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Size of the character\|size of the character]]

##### Distance, terrain, and circumstances

When it comes to distance (whether narrative or combat), the success of overcoming it is influenced by circumstances such as terrain complexity, gravity strength, or thin air.

>[!example] 
>- A strong snowstorm can add a CL +2.
>- A high mountain can add a CL +4

Movement circumstances (whether terrain or weather, and so on) can be applied at any time and as needed. Sometimes the circumstance is so strong that before the main roll, the character must also make a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|skill check]] of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill. For instance, when they are in deep water or flying in low gravity.

##### Change in Movement Speed

The final challenge level (derived from distance) can also change based on how fast the character is moving. For example, when a character is rushing to overtake someone (say, in a race), or when they are slowly sneaking through a garden to avoid guards.

Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Slower movement has the advantage of the character moving much more quietly, but on the other hand, it takes longer. The advantage is that the character's challenge level decreases (for example, when walking through dry leaves), while the disadvantage is that the guards will roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] multiple times in a row. This time disadvantage, however, breaks the rules. Because on one hand, it decreases the challenge level derived from the distance, which on the other hand "kind of" speeds up the character's movement through the terrain - since the challenge level also indicates how quickly the character moves through a given section (for example, at challenge 4 it is about 2 hours, or 4 rounds of rolling dice). So what should the Narrator do?

Well, when a character moves slower, the challenge level decreases when solving problems (i.e., when rolling skills). However, the time is extended. If a character, for example, reduces the challenge by 2 (by moving slowly), their time is extended by 2. So, for a distance of 3, they will have challenges with CL 1, but it will extend their time to 5 ( 10 hours, or 5 rounds of rolling dice ).

* Slowly
	- Description:
		- The character moves slowly, carefully, or quietly.        
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 2 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 2.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance increases by +2.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +2 extra dice rolls.

- Slower    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves slower, more carefully, or more quietly.
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 1 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 1 success, or the CL for the enemy increases by 1.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance increases by +1.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +1 extra dice roll.

- Normal    
	- No changes

- Faster    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves a bit faster, more recklessly, or noisier.
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 1 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 1 success, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 1.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance decreases by 1.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 1 fewer dice roll.

- Even faster    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves even faster, more recklessly, or noisier.     
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 2 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 2.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance decreases by 2.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 2 fewer dice rolls.

>[!example]
The character is sneaking down a corridor with guards. However, they are in a great hurry because the enemy will activate their superweapon in 3 rounds.
>
The character decides to go 'even faster.' Thanks to this, they will overtake the enemy, but on the other hand, the guards may detect the character sooner because, to detect them, they need to overcome a much lower challenge level in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|perception]] rolls.
>
(In this case, it can be that the character rolls [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] and rolls 4 successes. This becomes the challenge level for the guards. They will roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] – but because the character is in a hurry, they only need to overcome CL 2 instead of CL 4.)

#### Narrative Height

Narrative height refers to the height that a character must overcome when jumping somewhere. Narrative height also includes depth when a character is falling from some height. It can also refer to the depth of the sea when a character is swimming in an underwater cave. It can also refer to flight altitude when a character is flying in an airplane. We have summarized all these cases in the following lists, assigning a challenge level to each height (or depth). The lists use challenge levels that have already been adjusted to account for normal human abilities.

However, if a height in the story is not a whole number (e.g., 4.2 m), the number is rounded "up" to determine the challenge level (in the case of 4.2 m, it will be 5 m).

##### Narrative Height

This list of challenges accounts for **jumping up** (when a character jumps somewhere), **jumping down** (when a character jumps into a pit), or even **leaping over** (when a character jumps across a chasm).

1. Height 2 m
2. Height 4 m
3. Height 8 m
4. Height 16 m
5. Height 32 m
6. Height 64 m
7. Height 128 m
8. Height 256 m
9. Height 512 m

##### Narrative Height (flying an airplane)

If a character is flying an airplane (and so on), they need to fly at a certain height above the ground to avoid crashing into a tower or tree. Therefore, the lower they fly (for instance, to avoid radar), the more challenging it will be for them to maneuver without crashing. The list below assumes a character flying a typical light airplane. Therefore, if the character in the story is flying something heavier, the Narrator should adjust this scale accordingly. The heavier the airplane, the higher the challenge at lower altitudes.

1. Height 512 m
2. Height 256 m
3. Height 128 m
4. Height 64 m
5. Height 32 m
6. Height 16 m
7. Height 8 m
8. Height 4 m
9. Height 2 m
10. Height 1 m
11. Height approximately 0 m

##### Narrative Depth

When a character swims in the sea, they swim at a certain depth. The deeper they dive, the more difficult swimming becomes due to increased water pressure and currents that are not present at shallower depths. The scale below reflects this challenge, accounting for a typical character swimming with regular diving equipment. However, if a character is swimming in a submarine (or something that protects them from pressure), like with distances, the machine subtracts some value from the challenge (for example, a personal submarine CL - 8).

1. Depth 2 m
2. Depth 4 m
3. Depth 8 m
4. Depth 16 m
5. Depth 32 m
6. Depth 64 m
7. Depth 128 m
8. Depth 256 m
9. Depth 512 m

#### Narrative Weight

It is used when characters want to lift something or someone, move something, push something. Simply put, they have to exert effort against some weight. Narrative weight has nothing to do with the character's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Inventory\|inventory]] (and the items in it).

Secondly, the challenge of narrative weight is relative. It will be determined differently, for example, in a world full of giants or in an ant world. Therefore, the Narrator must adjust this list (below) according to the story. The lists use challenge levels that have already been adjusted to account for normal human abilities.

0. wt. 5 Kg. (e.g., newborn, vacuum cleaner, watermelon)
1. wt. 10 Kg. (e.g., child, bucket of paint, tire)
2. wt. 20 Kg. (e.g., large bucket of paint, leopard, dumbbells)
3. wt. 40 Kg. (e.g., toilet, washing machine)
4. wt. 80 Kg. (e.g., baby elephant, bags of cement)
5. wt. 160 Kg. (e.g., refrigerator, large piano)
6. wt. 320 Kg. (e.g., deer, compressor, trailer)
7. wt. 640 Kg. (e.g., seven refrigerators, camel)
8. wt. 1 t. (e.g., car, minibus, medium-sized boat)
9. wt. 3 t. (e.g., rhinoceros, small truck, jeep)
10. wt. 5 t. (e.g., tank)
11. wt. 10 t
12. wt. 20 t
13. wt. 41 t
14. wt. 82 t
15. wt. 164 t
16. wt. 328 t
17. wt. 655 t
18. wt. 1 K.t
19. wt. 3 K.t
20. wt. 5 K.t

[Weight of Stuff – We like to weigh stuff so you don't have to](https://weightofstuff.com/)

- ton = 1000 kg
- kilo ton = 1000 t    
- mega ton = 1 million t    
- giga ton = 1 billion t

The challenge level from weight is reduced by objects or machines designed for lifting. The exact reduction must be determined by the Narrator, as each machine has different capabilities. (The list below includes machines or objects that operate in kilograms).

* Magic strength gloves = (minus) 1 CL
* Furniture moving straps = (minus) 2 CL
* Forklift = (minus) 7 CL
* Small crane = (minus) 10 CL

#### Timing of skills

It is used in the story when characters want to lift something and hold it for a certain time (for example, a burning coal, which is part of a courage ritual), or used for spells, for example when a character summons an elemental with a short lifespan.

##### Challenge level and time

0. Minute
1. 30 minutes
2. Hour
3. 12 hours
4. Day
5. 4 days
6. Week
7. 2 weeks
8. Month
9. 3 months
10. Half a year
11. Year
12. Two years
13. Five years
14. Ten years
15. Twenty years
16. etc.

##### CL, Time, and Speeding Up or Slowing Down

When a character needs to, they can speed up their action (e.g., disarming a bomb when there's no time, so they must hurry). Or when doing something complicated and wanting to concentrate - they can "slow down" their action. It's the same rule as with distances and movement speed, just slightly adjusted. Mainly in that for the required time to perform an action, the challenge list from the time is used (as shown above).

- Slowly    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action slowly, carefully, or quietly.   
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 2 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 2.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action increases by +2 (e.g., instead of 1 hour, it will take 1 day).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +2 extra dice rolls.

- Slower    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action slower, more carefully, or more quietly.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 1 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 1.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action increases by +1 (e.g., instead of 1 hour, it will take a few hours).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +1 extra dice roll.

- Normal    
    - No changes

- Faster    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action a bit faster, more recklessly, or noisier.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 1 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 1 success, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 1.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action decreases by 1 (e.g., instead of 1 day, it will take a few hours).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 1 fewer dice roll.

- Even Faster    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action even faster, more recklessly, or noisier.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 2 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 2.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action decreases by 2 (e.g., instead of 1 day, it will take an hour).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 2 fewer dice rolls.

##### The size of the character

The size of the character determines how quickly and stealthily the character moves. These rules about character size can also be applied during [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], or when players face challenges (where they have to roll a skill, such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]], to pass unnoticed). The character's size also affects the size of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Inventory\|Inventory]].

### Dice in general

When a player decides they want to do something in the story, they must determine whether they will succeed or not. This is done using six-sided dice (D6). The player rolls them, and based on the result, the narrator decides success or failure of the intended action.

- If a **1, 2, or 3** appears on the die, it is a failure for that roll.    
- If a **4, 5, or 6** appears on the die, it is a success for that roll.

Failed rolls are ignored. Only the rolls with successes are counted, and each success is counted as one piece. The number on the die is ignored—4, 5, or 6 is the same success. To surpass the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]], the player must roll enough successes—more or equal to the challenge level.

> [!example]
> 
> - A character wants to climb over a fence secretly so that no one notices.
> - The narrator assigns a challenge level of 3 because it's harder than a normal fence climb.
> 
> - The character rolls dice and needs to roll 3 successes.
> -  If they roll 3 successes, they climb over the fence.
> - If they roll 2, 1, or 0 successes, they won't climb over the fence, or they fall from it, or knock something off the fence, making noise and alerting all the guards nearby.

The number of dice a character can roll is determined by their attribute and skill points. For each point in an attribute or skill, the character gets one extra die. For each minus in an attribute or skill, the character loses one die.

#### How Many Dice Can I Use for a Roll?

1. Each character or enemy gets 3 dice for each roll.
2. Additional dice are given for each point invested in the used skill (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] +1).
3. Additional dice are given for each point in the main [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]] that enhances used skill (e.g., for the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], it's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]).
4. Additional dice are given for each point invested in a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] that can be used to solve the problem. If the character doesn't have the talent but the situation requires it, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].
5. Additional dice are given for items the character has (e.g., glasses +1).
6. Additional dice are given for circumstances (e.g., it's foggy).

> [!example]
> * A character wants to open a chest without a key – using lockpicking.
> * The character has: 2 points in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]" and 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] is a supplementary attribute for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]).
> * The character gets 3 dice as a base + 2 dice from the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]" + 1 die from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].
> * The character can use 6 dice for their roll.

> [!example]
> * A character wants to convince a merchant that the samurai sword he wants to sell is much rarer than it actually is.
> * The character has: +3 in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]", +2 in the samurai [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] (because he is selling a samurai sword), and 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] is a supplementary attribute for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]).
> * The character gets 3 dice as a base + 3 dice from the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]" + 2 dice from the samurai [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] + 1 die from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]].
> * The character can use 9 dice for their roll.

Each character gets at least 1 die for their roll, even if they have a lot of minuses (e.g., from injury or circumstances).

### Advantage and Disadvantage

#### Advantage

When the narrator decides that fate favors the character, or the character has a favorable position, or the character decides to use 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]. In this case, the win threshold shifts in favor of the character. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1 or 2**, it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of Advantage)    
- If the die rolls a **3, 4, 5, or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of Advantage)

#### Great Advantage

It works the same way as advantage. It is used when one character in a fight has equipment like from the Middle Ages and the other has equipment from the distant future, or when the character decides to use 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]. In this case, the win threshold shifts in favor of the character. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1**, it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of great Advantage)    
- If the die rolls a **2, 3, 4, 5, or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of great Advantage)

#### Disadvantage

When the narrator decides that fate is not in the character's favor, or the character has an unfavorable position. Or when the character lacks a talent and the situation requires that talent. Or when the character lacks specialization (or talent) for a weapon and the weapon requires specialization. Or when the character decides to restore 1 used [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. In this case, the win threshold may shift against the player. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1, 2, 3, or 4,** it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of Disadvantage)  
- If the die rolls a **5 or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of Disadvantage)

#### Great Disadvantage

It works the same way as disadvantage. It is used when a character lacks talent or specialization for magic and intends to use magic. Or when a character lacks a talent required for the situation, and the solution to the situation is very complex even for someone with education. Or when a character lacks specialization (or talent) for a weapon, and the weapon requires specialization, especially if it is a very complex weapon. Or when the character decides to restore 2 used [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. In this case, the win threshold may shift against the player. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1, 2, 3, 4, or 5,** it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of great Disadvantage)    
- If the die rolls a **6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of great Disadvantage)

### Success and Failure

When a character rolls dice, all successes on their dice are counted. Then they are compared to the challenge level and evaluated. After rolling dice, the following cases may occur :

#### Complete Success

The character surpasses the challenge level and only successes appear on all their dice. For example, if the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] is 3 and the character rolled 6 successes out of 6 dice, it means the character will successfully accomplish the task exactly as they intended, and they may also receive a bonus from the narrator.

> [!example]
> - A character opens a chest without a key - they find rare metals or something important that makes the game easier for them.
> - A character doesn't open the chest without a key because they suddenly discover there's a bomb inside. The chest can be safely defused to prevent it from exploding somewhere. For example, it can blow up a wall or a door.

In case of full success, the narrator may decide to reduce the character's challenge level in the next roll, or give them an automatic success in the next roll.

- List of Complete Success (levels)
- 1 / 1 = no bonus    
- 2 / 2 = no bonus    
- 3 / 3 = -1 challenge level or +1 success    
- 4 / 4 = -1 challenge level or +1 success    
- 5 / 5 = -2 challenge level or +2 successes    
- 6 / 6 = -3 challenge level or +3 successes    
- 7 / 7 = -4 challenge level or +4 successes    
- 8 / 8 = -5 challenge level or +5 successes    
- more than 8 = -6 challenge level or +6 successes

#### Success

The character surpasses the challenge level. For example, if the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] is 3 and the character rolled 3 successes or more, then the character will successfully accomplish the task exactly as they intended. Or it might happen slightly differently, depending on the narrator. But it's always a success.

> [!example]
> - A character opens a chest without a key - they find gold or something important.
>  - A character doesn't open the chest without a key because they suddenly discover there's a bomb inside.

Alternatively, the character's challenge level for the next roll can be reduced by 1 upon success.

#### Story Failure

The character does not surpass the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]]. For example, if the challenge level is 3 and the character rolled 2 successes or less, then the character will not accomplish the task they wanted to do because they failed in their action. The character made a mistake, or something went wrong. The narrator will say exactly how the character failed and what happened.

> [!example]
> - The character opens the chest despite missing the challenge level, but the chest is empty.
> - Or they couldn't open the chest.
> - Or there was a bomb in the chest that exploded.

The level of story failure depends on how much the character missed the challenge level. The fewer successes the character has, the worse the outcome.

>[!example]
>The character tries to climb a wall at night, especially secretly so that no one sees them. The challenge level is 4.
>- 4 successes = Success, the character managed to climb the wall.
>- 3 successes = The character climbs up the wall, jumps through a window, and there is a guard.
>- 2 successes = The character slips, breaks a part of the wall, and it falls down. It can injure another character, or the stone can fall on the guards and they notice the character.
>- 1 success = The character falls from the wall. They must roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|dice]] to see if they can hold on or survive the fall.

#### Complete Failure

The character not only fails to surpass the challenge level, but also rolls no successes at all—only failures. In this case, not only does the character fail to accomplish the task they wanted to do, but something much worse happens.

> [!example]
> - The character opens the chest and a monster appears that they must defeat.
> - Or they make a noise and guards come
> - Or the bomb in the chest explodes and the floor collapses under the character.
> - The character falls from the wall and breaks their leg. Their fall and cry are heard by all the guards nearby.

In case of complete failure, the narrator may decide to increase the character's challenge level in the next roll, or the character automatically loses dice in the next roll.

- List of Complete Failure (levels)
- 1 / 1 = nothing    
- 2 / 2 = nothing    
- 3 / 3 = +1 challenge level or -1 die    
- 4 / 4 = +1 challenge level or -1 die    
- 5 / 5 = +2 challenge level or -2 dice    
- 6 / 6 = +3 challenge level or -3 dice    
- 7 / 7 = +4 challenge level or -4 dice    
- 8 / 8 = +5 challenge level or -5 dice    
- more than 8 = +6 challenge level or -6 dice

#### The Narrator Always Decides

What happens in case of success or failure is always decided by the narrator, who adjusts the story accordingly. A success doesn't always have to be a pure success (or gain), but it can also be opening a door behind which another path for the character might be waiting. Similarly, failure doesn't always have to be a "failure" (or loss), but it can be a new obstacle that leads the characters to the same goal, but through a different path than they intended. Everything depends solely on the story and the narrator.

#### Transfer of Successes

When characters perform the same action and one character fails their dice roll—meaning they don't surpass the challenge level while others do—those characters who surpassed the challenge level can help the one who didn't. They do this by transferring their successes. The number of successes that successful characters can transfer depends on the challenge level. They can only transfer successes that exceed the challenge level.

> [!example]
> A very dangerous enemy appears and the characters need to hide in a haystack.
> The characters roll their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|stealth]] skill against a challenge level of 3.
> 
> 1 character rolls 4 successes (surpassed [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] and could transfer 1 success)
> 2 character rolls 3 successes (surpassed [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] but can't transfer any success)
> 3 character rolls 2 successes (didn't surpass the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]], needs 1 success)
> 
> Character 1 helps Character 3 by transferring one of its successes. All characters successfully hide, even at the last moment.

Transferring successes can happen in all actions that characters perform together and simultaneously. Except in the case of attacking an enemy, which is considered fighting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances#Boj s viacerými nepriateľmi\|multiple enemies]].

### Skill check - dice roll

Skill check is rolled when something prevents a character from performing an action.

   >[!example]
  >- A character is in deep water and wants to attack someone.
  >- The water impedes their movement, so the character must roll a control check for the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]].

When a character is in difficult circumstances that hinder their activity, the narrator determines which skill (and with which talent) will be rolled for the control check. The narrator also sets the Challenge Level ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]]), which depends on the difficulty of the situation. For example, deep water might have a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] of 3, while deep water with a strong current might have a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] of 5.

If the character succeeds in the control check, they can perform (and roll) their intended action exactly as they want. The character can get into the next roll as many successes as they exceeded the challenge level. These successes reserve dice for the next roll (see note below).

If the character does not meet the challenge level, they cannot perform the intended action at all, or they lose as many dice in the next roll as they were short of the challenge level.

> [!info] In the game, it will look like this:
> - A character is in deep water and wants to attack someone.
> - The narrator says that the character must roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] against a challenge level of 3.
> <br>
> - The character rolls, for example, 4 successes.
> - This means they can attack the enemy (i.e., roll directly for the combat roll).
> - At the same time, 1 success from their combat roll is reserved for them.
> - This means that if they have, for example, 6 dice in the combat roll, 1 die is automatically converted into a success.
> - And therefore, they will roll with only 5 dice.


</div></div>


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/02-dice/rpg-quick-check/#quick-check-dice-roll" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



### Quick check - dice roll

In the story, there might be situations where a character needs to quickly react to a danger that could cause injury or death. In these situations, the narrator will tell, which skill the character must roll. For every point the character misses the challenge level, they lose that many [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]. After successful Quick Check, the character does not receive any success or dice for the next roll.

> [!example]
>- The character is falling from a great height.
>- The narrator says they must roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]" against a CL of 4.
>- Let's say the character rolls with 6 dice and gets 3 success.
>- They missed the CL by 1, so they take 1 injury (i.e., -1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]).

>[!example]
> - The character is driving and another car is rushing towards them
> - The narrator says they must roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]]" to avoid the car.
> - The CL is 4, and the character rolls with 7 dice, getting 5 success.
> -The character successfully meets the CL and takes no injury.

#### Quick skill check and Luck roll

If the narrator doesn't know what difficulty to assign to a quick action, they can roll for luck, with the following results:

1. Great misfortune = CL 6 or CL 3 + the CL the narrator wanted
2. Major misfortune = CL 5 or CL 2 + the CL the narrator wanted
3. Minor misfortune = CL 4 or CL 1 + the CL the narrator wanted
4. Minor fortune = CL 3 or CL 1 - the CL the narrator wanted
5. Major fortune = CL 2 or CL 2 - the CL the narrator wanted
6. Great fortune = CL 1 or CL 3 - the CL the narrator wanted

### Quick Reaction - Dice roll

In the story, there may be a situation where a character wants to act immediately, but cannot because they are doing something else, carrying a heavy backpack, and the situation has "escalated quickly".

If the character wants to react immediately - they must roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]" against the challenge level determined by the narrator. If they pass the challenge level, they can react immediately and continue with another skill or roll. (For example, if they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] and pass the challenge level, they can immediately roll a combat roll.)

If the character does not pass the challenge level, they must wait an extra round (or however many rounds they missed the challenge level by).

The character does not receive any success or dice for the next roll in a quick reaction roll.

### Assistance – dice roll

Assistance is a special dice roll where multiple characters join together to help each other. One character can help another, for example, with fixing a car, or they go together to break down doors and so on.

Assistance works the same way as the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Success and Failure#Transfer of Successes\|Transfer of Successes]]. So characters roll the same dice with the same skills against the same challenge level. When characters surpass the challenge level, they transfer their successes (those above the level) to the character they are assisting. This also means that if the helping characters fail the roll, nothing is transferred (and nothing is reduced). Similarly, nothing is transferred when the helping characters reach the challenge level. They must exceed it.

> [!example]
> * Character 1 wants to break down a door. 
> * Character 2 decides to help them.
>  <br>
> * Character 1 will roll, for example, with 5 dice against a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] of 3
> * Helping Character can roll with 6 dice against [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] 3
> <br>
> * Character 1 rolls, for example, 2 successes
> * Helping Character rolls, for example, 4 successes. They can transfer 1 success ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] 3 - 4 successes)
> <br>
> * 1 success is transferred to Character 1, allowing them to surpass the challenge level. And the characters break down the door together.

The character (who wants to help) must ask the narrator if they can help the other character. When the narrator agrees, the "helper" will roll dice with the same skill as the character. They can also use a talent if it applies to the problem (for example, the pyrotechnics [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] to defuse a bomb). The base challenge level for assistance is the same as the challenge level of the activity being assisted. When a character assists an activity that requires a talent and the assisting character does not have that [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]], they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

Multiple characters can help one character. However, if it's a roll where characters can get hurt and the characters fail, all characters (including those who helped) will receive the same damage as the character being helped, though the damage is reduced by armor for each character separately.

Assistance cannot be used on an assistance roll that is meant to assist something. It can only be used once and on the final roll. If a character is performing something difficult or time-consuming, they cannot participate in assistance. Other characters must wait until it is completed.

### Self-assistance

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] cannot be used to assist another character; that's what [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Assistance\|Assistance]] is for. The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] roll  is used when the character wants to help themselves, or during [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Quick check\|quick skill check]], or as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Quick Reaction\|Quick Reaction]], or during combat when the character wants to use a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]] or an item.

The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] roll is made just like any other regular roll, but against the challenge level set by the narrator. The minimum level, however, is 3. The number of successes achieved in the self-assistance roll are reduced by the challenge level and then transferred as wins to the next roll (they are helping). It can happen that the number of wins from the self-assistance roll is lower than the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]] - in such a case, the wins are subtracted from the next roll.

### Chase - dice roll

Chase is rolled when one character tries to escape from another character, or when a character tries to escape from some threat. The narrator determines the moment from which the characters start chasing each other, as well as the distance from which the chase starts (chase may not start from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Chasing and Distances\|medium distance]]). The characters then roll dice against each other, meaning one rolls dice and successes are noted. Then the other rolls dice and successes are noted. And the difference between characters is evaluated.

If the "attacker" (the one chasing) has more successes, the distance between them decreases. If the attacker wins when they are close to their victim, the attacker catches the victim. If the attacker is closer, they can use their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] or luck to stop the victim. They can push their victim against a wall, or even if they are on a horse, they can injure the horse to make the victim fall. When the attacker catches the victim, the attacker gets one advantage - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances#Výhodnejšie postavenie\|better position]].

When the victim wins more often, they distance themselves from the attacker, and if the victim is sufficiently far away, they escape from the attacker.

#### Chase and Distance

* **Close**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, they catch the victim.
        * A combat roll is then made additionally, with the attacker gaining an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances#Advantageous position\|advantage]] to their roll.
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, the distance between them increases to "medium."
* **Medium Distance**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, the distance decreases to "close."
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, the distance increases to "greater."
* **Greater Distance**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, the distance between them decreases to "medium."
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, the distance between them changes to "great distance."
* **Greatest Distance**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, the distance decreases to "greater."
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, they escape from the attacker and the chase ends.

> [!note]
> There is a difference between perceiving closeness and distance – whether the character is in a car, a spaceship, or running on foot or on a horse. The distance is determined by the narrator.

#### How to Roll for Chase?

When a character is running - they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] skill. If a significant obstacle (such as a car) appears, it is necessary to make a skill check, for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], or any other appropriate skill before the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] roll. When a character is riding a horse or driving a car - they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]]. If an obstacle appears, it is necessary to make a check, for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], before driving, so the character notices the obstacle and can react better to it.

### Luck dice roll

Luck changes the current situation either for the better or for the worse. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] refers to what is happening around the character at that moment. Therefore, it can only affect the "now," at the place where the character is standing, or for approximately one hour. A luck roll made by a character in the middle of the game cannot change the end of the game, nor can its result appear six months later.

A luck roll is used when:

1. The character wants to determine if they will have luck in finding something (They need gasoline - they go to an abandoned gas station and roll for luck to see if there is any).
2. The character wants to determine if the change that just occurred will worsen or improve their situation (It starts raining - will it be a heavy rain or just a drizzle? Will it be thick rain that reduces visibility for the enemy or the character?).
3. Something happens and the character needs to react quickly (This determines the challenge level for solving the problem, for example, how many rounds they have to disarm a bomb).
4. The character finds a shop. Whether it will have everything they need and at what price (for example, the shop could be very expensive or it might not have what they are looking for).
5. The character is under attack - the dice determine the enemy's strength (for example, whether the enemy will have strong weapon and armor).
6. The narrator wants to change the story (The characters will travel to another city for a week. The narrator rolls the dice - if it results in luck - the characters find a treasure map, if it results in misfortune - the characters are attacked by bandits).

If the narrator wants, they can use the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter\|random encounter]] table to spice up the game, they don't have to rely solely on the luck rule.

#### Result of the Luck Roll and What It Means

Luck is rolled with a standard 6-sided die. In this case, it is as follows:

1. Great misfortune
2. Major misfortune
3. Minor misfortune
4. Minor fortune
5. Major fortune
6. Great fortune

##### 1. Great Misfortune

The greatest misfortune possible. It's as if all of Murphy's laws combined to cause harm.

 > [!example]
 > The character is going through a tunnel. They come across a secret door they want to open. They roll for luck to see what awaits them. They roll a 1. Behind the door is a secret enemy base and fully armed. By opening the door, character just triggered the alarm.

Other possibilities for Great Misfortune:

- The character is searching for something

    - Or the character finds the item, but using it increases the challenge level by 2 in every dice roll.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but in order to use it, they must solve a problem with a challenge level of 3.        
- Challenge Level    
    - The challenge level is 6, or CL +3.        
- Possibilities    
    - Among all the possibilities the narrator considers, this is the worst one. Much worse than intended.

    - The minimum price of an item is 6, or +3 to the character's disadvantage.        
    - If the character is selling something, the maximum price of the item is 1, or -3 from the price to the character's disadvantage.

- Disasters    
    - A large-scale disaster occurs near the character. It could be a few meters from where they stand or close family (e.g., spouse).        
- Services    
    - Only one service is available and it's poor quality.        
- Spell Failure    
    - Wizard is damaged by 3 HP, or : cannot cast spells for 3 days, major enemy enhancement, destruction of a magical item, room destruction.

    - The complete opposite of the potion's intended effect happens, and of course to the character's detriment.

##### 2. Major Misfortune

What wasn't supposed to go wrong, went wrong, or a coincidence worsened the current situation by about 100%.

> [!example]
> The character is going through a tunnel. They come across a secret door they want to open. They roll for luck to see what awaits them. They roll a 2.

##### 6. Great Fortune

The greatest fortune possible. Like a wish granted. In the current situation, one obstacle is resolved – by external intervention or by something the characters didn't know about.

 > [!example]
 > The character is going through a tunnel. They come across a secret door they want to open. They roll for luck to see what awaits them. They roll a 6. The door opens and they find not only the items they need in large quantities, but also new weapons, shields, helmets, or even the item needed to complete the mission.

Other possibilities for Great Fortune:

- The character is searching for something    
    - The character finds the item and can use it immediately. This item reduces the challenge level by 2 in every dice roll.        
- Challenge Level    
    - Challenge Level is 1, or CL -3.        
- Possibilities    
    - Among all the possibilities the narrator considers, this is the best one (even better than the narrator intended).        
- Severity (weather?)    
    - The situation improves by 200%, or no obstacles are added.        
- How many rounds are needed to solve the situation?    
    - 6 rounds (e.g., when the character is disarming a bomb or must close a door to stop water from flooding in.)        
- How many rounds will the bad thing last?    
    - 1 round (e.g., if it's burning, the character is poisoned, or an animal goes berserk, it takes 1 round to calm down.)        
- Random Encounter    
    - Improves the situation by 200%.        
    - Adds an extra obstacle that must be solved with a skill roll of challenge level 1.        
- Enemy    
    - Level 1        
    - The enemy or enemy group collectively has 1 point in attributes.   
    - The character may be attacked by a maximum of 1 enemy.        
	    - (1 point = e.g., STR 1). In skills, specialization, or spells, they have 1 point (e.g., Perception 1, or Samurai 1).      
- Shop    
    - The minimum price of an item is 1, or -3 to the character's advantage.        
    - If the character is selling something, the maximum price of the item is 6, or +3 to the price to the character's advantage.        
- Shop (Inventory)    
    - They have a lot in stock and in the best quality.        
- Story Spice-up    
    - Situation improves by 200%.        
    - Characters find a traveling merchant. They find a treasure map that shortens their journey fivefold. They find a trail that leads them directly to their destination. Another perfect event involving the caravan.        
- Disasters    
    - No disaster occurs.        
- Services    
    - All services are available in the best quality.        
- Spell Failure    
    - Nothing happens.        
- Bad Potion or Medicine Effect    
    - Nothing happens to the character.

### Character in general

In every story, there are characters who work, fight, and so on. Each player has their own character, which they either created themselves or was created by the narrator. The player uses this character to react to what happens in the story. They say everything their character will do, won’t do, wants to do, and what they're thinking about. The player does this similar to how actors portray roles in films – they ‘act’ out their character’s role. The narrator, on the other hand, plays all the other characters in the story that the players don’t control. They are the trader, the bandit, the taxi driver, the boss, the subordinate, and so on. And the narrator plays these characters just like actors in films.

The possibilities for creating characters are limited only by the narrator, their story, and the world’s or RPG system’s rules. What the narrator says or what they agree upon with the players is binding. When creating a character, the player should align the story’s rules with the type of setting or genre.

>[!example]
If it’s a medieval story with dragons, magic, and a crazy comedy theme, then the character could be similar to Jack Sparrow, in the form of a (clumsy) dragon tamer.

It’s also important to think about the fact that in a dangerous environment – the character can die. The RPG system has its rules. If the rules say the character must die, then there’s nothing that can be done about it. The player will then get a new character from the narrator or create a new one. However, in the story, it’s not just death; the character might fall unconscious and wake up elsewhere, turn into a zombie, or time rewinds when they die. (It all depends on the narrator and their story).

#### General Character Traits

Here we will outline some rules regarding characters, mainly the rules for [[Attributes\|Attributes]], [[Skills\|Skills]], [[Talents\|Talents]], and Points. These rules are briefly explained for basic understanding of the game's mechanics. More detailed rules are found in other chapters.

##### Character Attributes – General

Characters' passive attributes determine several things. They indicate what the character is strong at, average at, and weak at. They also determine how many dice the player (or character) gets for their roll, which character will act first in a fight (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Conflict\|conflict]]) and how many points (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health]]) the character gets.

Our RPG system uses 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attributes]]. These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|Strength]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|Reflex]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|Intelligence]], and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|Social Skills]]. Every point the player (or narrator) invests in an attribute increases the number of dice the player (or narrator) can use for their dice roll. This applies when they want to use a skill, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|attack]], defend, or use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|spells]] or techniques.

##### Character Skills – General

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skills]] are categories for actions a character can perform. When a problem arises in the story (e.g., the character needs to swim across a lake), the narrator will state which skill the character must use and then set a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]]. The character will then roll dice for that skill (e.g., for swimming across the lake, the skill is [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]]). Based on the dice roll, the narrator explains the outcome and how the story continues.

##### Character Talents - General

However, when the character does something complex – requiring education or specialization, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is added to the skill roll. But [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] can only be used in situations where specific education or knowledge is needed to solve a problem.

>[!example]
>Talent "Lifeguard" can be used with the skill "mobility" when the character wants to swim across a lake.
>Talent "Lifeguard" cannot be used for heart surgery or car repair.

If the story circumstances require a talent (e.g., heart surgery) but the character lacks it, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]], or if the task is very complex (even for someone with education), the character rolls at a major [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. The same applies to combat. If the character uses a weapon requiring some training (e.g., katana, pistol), they roll at a disadvantage.

##### Points - General

As for other things the character has or doesn't have – these are recorded as points. These include points for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Health]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Wealth]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Speed]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Training\|Training]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Rewards]], and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]. Each type of point serves a different purpose. Health Points decide the character's life or death. Wealth Points determine whether the character can purchase something. Speed Points dictate the combat order and what the character can carry in their inventory (whether in a backpack or hands). Reward Points are a bit complicated but essentially reward the player and offer options. Armor Points are used to block damage.

This is, of course, just a summary, and the exact rules are detailed in the relevant chapter for each point.

### Nature of the Character

An interesting story needs interesting characters. These are ones that have good qualities, some flaws, important goals, or a complicated past. Simply put, they should have ‘multiple dimensions’. Therefore, it is not suitable to create purely good characters (those who only do good), or purely evil characters (those who only do evil), because such characters tend to be boring from a story perspective.

Every person reacts to the surrounding world in some way. They behave in certain ways, experience misfortune, happiness, and so on. Therefore, characters in stories have personality traits that, although they may not affect the gameplay (i.e., dice rolls), are very important for the story, so the player knows (and especially doesn’t forget) how their character will behave in certain situations. (So the player can play them like an actor in a movie.)

In the list below, personality traits are written and categorized into several categories. The player can choose only one personality trait from each category. The chosen trait should best capture their character. Each trait has its ‘milder’ and ‘more extreme’ version. However, if the player or the narrator can't decide, they can roll the dice and let fate decide for them.

#### Character traits

##### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Community\|Community]]

This is a large category that influences the character's outward behavior towards their surroundings. It determines how the character behaves among people. Whether they prefer to be alone, or whether they take initiative when a problem arises that needs to be solved.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Sociability\|Sociability]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Introvert\|Introvert]] (6, 5) = This is a person who prefers to be alone or deals with a smaller number of people. Being in the company of strangers or large groups of people exhausts them. An introvert focuses on working with computers, books, or other inanimate objects. They dislike working with people (like doctors or salespeople). In extreme cases, they would prefer to be on a deserted island because other people literally drain the life out of them. They prefer interacting with their friends, family, or people they like and know well.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Ambivert\|Ambivert]] (4, 3) = This is a person who doesn’t mind solitude or company, as long as it’s not extreme or for too long. For example, they couldn't handle a deserted island, but also wouldn't enjoy a crowded disco. This person can tolerate people and work with them (as long as it’s not for too long, like meeting new people all week during lectures where they're the center of attention). They enjoy making new contacts but prefer turning them into long-term friends.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Extrovert\|Extrovert]] (2, 1) = This is a person who hates being alone. They always need someone around to talk to. They don’t like when people sit quietly next to each other without conversing. They enjoy working with people, know how to interact with them (like giving advice or managing their anger), and enjoy doing so. In extreme cases, they are constantly seeking out company because when they are alone, they get scared or depressed.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Friendliness\|Friendliness]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Friendly\|Friendly]] ( 6 , 5 ) = This type of person (relatively) quickly makes friends and tries to get along well with everyone. If they are in a foreign environment, they want to meet and befriend everyone—because everyone should be a friend, right? And if not, they feel sad. In extreme cases, they talk to everyone and immediately offer their friendship (and maybe even gifts).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Assertive\|Assertive]] ( 4 , 3 ) = This type of person approaches friendship neutrally. They don't force friendships or enmities and interact with people in a 'regular' way. Because not everyone can be a friend, and not everyone is immediately an enemy.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Unfriendly\|Unfriendly]] (2, 1) = This person doesn't need or want friends. They either manage on their own, isolate themselves from others, or deal with everyone formally. They don’t necessarily want to harm others, but for some, it's not out of the question. On the other hand, a lack of friends may be due to aggression or an inability to interact with people—they may be socially awkward or shy. In extreme cases, it appears the character suffers from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Disabling Characteristic#pol. 4 - Sociopatia\|sociopathy]].

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Trust in others\|Trust in others]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Paranoia\|Paranoia]] ( 6 , 5 ) = This person is hard to convince and always needs some proof. When walking down a quiet alley, they expect an attack. In extreme cases, this person trusts virtually nothing and no one (regardless of evidence). They need multiple reassurances that nothing is happening and that no one wants to deceive them.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Average Trust\|Average Trust]] ( 4 , 3 ) = This person knows the world is a dangerous place, but also knows it’s not always so. If they are walking down a quiet alley in a safe part of town, they know they are not in danger. In a dangerous part of town, they are cautious.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Trust\|Trust]] ( 2 , 1 ) = This person knows there are bad people, but believes there is good in every bad person—it just needs to be brought out. Maybe it’s all about the approach. No one is bad; maybe they just had a bad day. And if walking down a quiet alley, even in a dangerous part of town, they will behave as usual, believing they are not in danger. In extreme cases (2b), this person does not believe there are bad people or bad places. They essentially don't check people out. If they are walking down a quiet alley in the most dangerous part of town, they will be singing, believing nothing can harm them.
###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Activity\|Activity]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Initiative\|Initiative]] ( 6 , 5 ) = This person solves problems as soon as they arise and as quickly as possible. They don’t postpone anything until tomorrow, and if the situation requires something to be done, they do it. They hate when someone procrastinates. In extreme cases, this character is hyperactive and, when nothing is happening, they invent something to solve.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Mixed\|Mixed]] ( 4 , 3 ) = This person solves problems, but not necessarily immediately. If something can be postponed, it waits a bit.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Passivity\|Passivity]] ( 2 , 1 ) = This person postpones things. It’s best if problems resolve themselves. They don't like being pushed into solving problems, believing there’s always time. In extreme cases, this character won’t lift a finger, even after multiple urgings.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Perception of the World\|Perception of the World]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Optimism\|Optimism]] (6, 5) = This person perceives the world as better than it actually is and mainly experiences positive emotions. They see the glass as half-full and focus on the full part. In extreme cases, they are like a small sunshine, able to be happy (and spread happiness) even in a total disaster.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Realism\|Realism]] (4, 3) = This person perceives the world as it actually is (or at least tries to). When they see the glass as half-empty, they prepare for the possibility that it will be completely empty. If the glass is filled, they are glad their fears were unfounded.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Pessimism\|Pessimism]] (2, 1) = This person perceives the world as worse than it actually is and mainly experiences negative emotions. They see the glass as half-empty and focus on the empty part. In extreme cases, they are like a total dark cloud, able to be unhappy (and see bad things) even in completely positive situations or celebrations.

##### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Stability\|Stability]]

These are traits that affect the character's emotions, needs, and how they see themselves. All of these traits contribute to the overall emotional stability.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Cleanliness\|Cleanliness]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Chaos\|Chaos]] (6, 5) = This type of person can tolerate disorder. The fact that things are not in their place does not bother them at all (and honestly, they kind of like it because order is boring). It seems they navigate best in chaos—where things don’t necessarily have a head or tail. In extreme cases, they are the king of disorder and chaos, having mess everywhere. (But they know their way around it, at least in 60% of cases). However, their improvisation skills are really strong.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Balance\|Balance]] (4, 3) = This type of person can tolerate a bit of disorder, as long as there is a good reason for it (like when renovating an apartment). But long-term disorder can frustrate them and worsen their overall mood.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Order\|Order]] (2, 1) = This person loves routine and when everything is in its place. They hate disorder (you could even call it an allergy) and are totally lost in chaos (or anything that deviates from order). Things must have a head and a tail. In extreme cases, they are the king of order and routine.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Emotional Response\|Emotional Response]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Sensitive\|Sensitive]] (6, 5) = This person expresses emotions openly. They can’t hide their feelings, and when something is sad, they will be sad and cry. They can empathize with others' emotions and predict how people will react. In extreme cases, this person expresses their emotions too much.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Stable\|Stable]] (4, 3) = Regarding emotions and reading others' emotions, this type of person is average in this skill. However, they have their limit on how long they can control their emotions. Once this limit is exceeded, they will express their emotions.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Stoic\|Stoic]] (2, 1) = As for emotions, this person is not easily shaken. They can perfectly control their reactions to events and there is practically no one who can make them angry. On the other hand, they demand perfect control from others as well. They cannot empathize with others' feelings, or they generally dislike emotions. In extreme cases, they are like a walking logical stone.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Stimuli\|Stimuli]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Excitable\|Excitable]] (6, 5) = This person needs excitement in their life. Something must always be happening, and if it’s not, they will make it happen. They love risk, gambling, and adrenaline activities. They enjoy trying new things. In extreme cases, adrenaline is like a drug for this person.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Moderately Excitable\|Moderately Excitable]] (4, 3) = This person needs a small amount of excitement in their life. They know when to stop, when to take risks, and they also know how to relax. They don’t mind boredom.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Conservative\|Conservative]] (2, 1) = This type of person hates new things, is afraid of adrenaline activities, and dislikes risk. They are happy when nothing changes and everything stays as it was. They don’t like new things; for example, they can wear clothes until they fall apart. In extreme cases, it’s even worse—they avoid anything that looks even a bit new (new game?) or adrenaline-inducing. They cling only to what they know and let nothing new into their life.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Self-Confidence\|Self-Confidence]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/High Self-Confidence\|High Self-Confidence]] (6, 5) = This person believes in themselves. They know they are always right, and they know they can do and solve everything. In extreme cases, this self-confidence is so extreme it becomes arrogance (I am infallible, why are you blaming me?).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Average Self-Confidence\|Average Self-Confidence]] (4, 3) = This person knows their limits. They know what they can and cannot do.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Low Self-Confidence\|Low Self-Confidence]] (2, 1) = This person doesn't believe in themselves. And even if they had three physics diplomas, they would question everything they say unless they really fact-checked it. In extreme cases, this fact-checking is so frequent it borders on OCD (like checking 300 times if they turned off the gas on the stove).

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Lives In\|Lives In]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Fantasy\|Fantasy]] (6, 5) = This person is characterized by abstract thinking. They can imagine things that other people cannot. They live more in the world of fantasy than in the real one. They hate working with facts. In extreme cases, this person lives only in fantasy and is not interested in the real world.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Reality\|Reality]] (4, 3) = This person focuses on the real world. Sometimes they dive into the world of fantasy to relax, but they know life is lived only in the real world. When it comes to their ability to dream and imagine, they are average. They can't imagine everything. On the other hand, they can work with facts.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Facts\|Facts]] (2, 1) = This person is characterized by strict thinking. They can recall factual things that other people cannot. They live mainly in the real world rather than in fantasy. They hate working with imagination. Everything must be supported by solid data—no beliefs, no magic—everything must make sense. In extreme cases, they hate everything that even hints at fantasy. They simply don't believe it or they despise it.

##### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Morality\|Morality]]

This is a category of traits that affect the character's conscience, rule-following, and overall responsibility. Can they lie? Can they sacrifice for the good of others?

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Rule-Following\|Rule-Following]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Flexible\|Flexible]] (6, 5) = This is a person who knows how to bend the rules for their benefit—those they don’t like, they either ignore or interpret to suit themselves. In extreme cases, rules don’t exist for this person.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]] (4, 3) = This person follows rules as long as they make sense. If something is nonsensical (or against their moral principles), they ignore it.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Rigid\|Rigid]] (2, 1) = This person follows rules to the letter. Whether they make sense or not, they were written for a reason and, most importantly, to be followed. In extreme cases, nothing but rules exist—and they must be followed to the letter of the law.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Personality Orientation\|Personality Orientation]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Orbicentric\|Orbicentric]] (6, 5) = This person focuses on the external world and not on themselves (meaning they hardly acknowledge their own needs) and sacrifices for others. Others must be helped—they do not need help themselves. In extreme cases, they prioritize the whole world over their needs.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Centric\|Centric]] (4, 3) = This person is aware of their needs and also the needs of others. They help people based on the context (e.g., in terms of health), whether they can help themselves (because people can exploit kindness), and whether it won’t harm them (e.g., losing all their money).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Egocentric\|Egocentric]] (2, 1) = This person sees only their needs and the needs of others as if they don't exist. To help others, someone must force them or reward them greatly. In extreme cases, they think only of themselves and their needs.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Diligence\|Diligence]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Workaholism\|Workaholism]] (6, 5) = This person loves work. To the extent that they can immerse themselves in it for long hours, regardless of their personal life, the needs of others, and circumstances. The work must be done (this doesn't mean it has to be completed immediately). In extreme cases, they do not stop working.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Average hard worker\|Average hard worker]] (4, 3) = As for work, this person knows when something needs to be done, it needs to be done. On the other hand, they don’t overdo it with work and will pause when tired or when other circumstances arise (and possibly rest).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Laziness\|Laziness]] (2, 1) = This person hates work. They would prefer to rest all day and delay everything indefinitely. They do things at the last minute, after multiple prompts. However, they do focus on others (e.g., their personal life flourishes, just don't expect anything immediately from them). In extreme cases, this person rarely does or completes anything.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Needs\|Needs]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Self-Control\|Self-Control]] (6, 5) = This person can delay gratification and tolerate long periods of frustration, believing that their patience will be generously rewarded. In extreme cases, they refuse pleasure and take joy in denying themselves something.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Sustainable\|Sustainable]] (4, 3) = This person can give up pleasure, but only for a short time. If frustration lasts too long, they lose control (although this depends on their moral compass).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Gluttony\|Gluttony]] (2, 1) = This person wants everything immediately. If you place a kilogram of chocolate in front of them, they will literally eat it all. When there is something they want to buy, they do so almost immediately. (Their gluttony depends on their moral compass). In extreme cases, this person really cannot control themselves.

#### Basic Belief About Oneself

Everyone thinks something about themselves. They are convinced that they are one way or another. This fundamental belief is the foundation of a character, whether they realize it or not. This belief speaks about what the character thinks about themselves, the world, or society. A character might reject emotions and consider anyone who expresses emotions as inferior. They might think of themselves as a total loser who doesn’t deserve anything good. Or they might believe that whatever they do, they only do good for others—that they are always right and always help. They might think that all people are fundamentally good—that they can find goodness even in the worst person. All these beliefs are caused by some event from the past.

Every good story must “attack” this fundamental belief and test the character. Among other things, this can be done by bringing together several characters with conflicting beliefs in one story. Or by putting the character in a situation that shows how their fundamental belief doesn’t work.

#### Character values

Everyone makes decisions based on something. Some things are more important to them than others. This importance is reflected in the so-called ranking of character's values, where a person (or character) arranges desires, goals, objects, people, and so on into a list. The position of each item is very important because things higher up the hierarchy have higher priority and will be preferred. If the character has to choose between two options, they will always choose the one that satisfies the needs (or things) higher up.

Creating a hierarchy is quite simple. One must ask themselves if they could "sacrifice this for something else." For example, family and money. Is the character capable of sacrificing their family for money? And what about art? Is art priceless to the character? The top spots are taken by things that the character would never sacrifice and that are very important to them (therefore, they will take the best care of these things).

#### Character Affinity

The player decides what their character likes (for example, cats, food, video games?), then determines what their character can ignore, while others cannot (for example, they are not bothered by blood?), and finally, the player decides what their character absolutely hates or fears (for example, they hate dogs, refuse to play certain music, are annoyed by books, don't want to attack children). Character affinity serves as a memory aid for the player so that, in the heat of the game, they do not forget what their character avoids or seeks out.

#### Color of a Character

This is simply a tool to help the player or narrator in designing the character. It involves colors (a maximum of 3) that are typical for the character. This could be the color of their hair, the color of the clothes they wear, the color of objects they prefer, or even the color of the magic they use (for example, they wear green clothes and dark green shoes, and have brown hair).

Similarly, shape is also related to color. The player or narrator determines which shape or shapes (a maximum of 2) are typical for the character. Is the character round or does it have "sharp edges" like a cuboid? What is their body posture like? Are they upright and straight, or hunched?

Lastly, there are typical objects associated with the character. Someone might always hold a TV remote control. Someone else might always wear a hat of a certain brand and color. Or someone might always be smeared with motor oil.

#### Belief / Morality

Everyone believes in something, has their unique view of the world, and decides what is good and what is evil. So, a realistic character should also have some stance or moral compass. It can also include faith or a life philosophy. Even the search for one's life philosophy can be considered a life philosophy.

However, if a player or narrator chooses a moral compass, a hierarchy of values, and so on, they should strive to play the character according to THEIR moral compass, not their own. For example, if a player would never steal, but their character is a thief who doesn't care, then the character will steal and have a unique approach to others' property (What is yours is mine. What is mine is none of your business).

#### Goals / Desires

We all want to accomplish something. Each of us wants to do or complete something. Similarly, a character must have some goals. One or two main ones that they always adhere to, and then smaller ones that lead towards the main goals.

Everyone wants to achieve something in life. This can range from big things like world peace to quite ordinary ones like “paying off a mortgage.” Therefore, a character should be assigned something they want to achieve. Naturally, everything should be within the rules of the given world and should be derived from the character's past. It is recommended that the character has multiple goals and desires, both big and small, so that players strive to achieve multiple things in the story.

#### Character's Past

Every character has "something behind them" that got them to where they are now and shaped them into their "current form." The character's past should reflect all the points invested in attributes, skills, and so on, and should also reflect the character's hierarchy of values and settings. However, the past should not be overly detailed to take up an entire book. A few interesting sentences are enough to make everything the player wrote in the character sheet make sense.

>[!example]
A mechanic could have learned their craft at school or from their father. They might love or hate repairing cars—perhaps their father pushed them into mechanics.

### Groups of characters

Characters in our RPG system are divided into two main groups: Playable and Non-Playable. Playable characters are those controlled by players, while Non-Playable characters are controlled by the narrator. Additionally, characters are classified based on their importance to the story. See the list below.

#### Extras

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Friendly Extra character\|Friendly Extra character]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unfriendly Extra character\|Unfriendly Extra character]]

What it is = A group of characters that serve merely as distraction. They are very weak fighters. To defeat them, the challenge level must be overcome. If a player fails to meet the challenge level – they still kill them but take damage based on how much they fall short of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]].

For example = In Left 4 Dead, these would be the standard zombies found everywhere.

Permissions = They have no talents, do not roll dice for attacks or skills. Exceptionally, they may have one magical ability (e.g., exploding upon death).

b. Attributes = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/HP\|HP]] is the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] needed to defeat the extras. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/HP\|HP]] is determined by the narrator (for example, they can roll a luck die).

b. Skills = 2 points (if they have any special ability).

b. Damage = based on how much the character falls short of the challenge level.

#### Unimportant Character

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Character\|Unimportant Character]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Enemy\|Unimportant Enemy]]

What it is = A character stronger than extras. This character doesn’t have a name, just a single title and function.

For example = guards on the castle walls, snow demons, or like the special zombies (Spitter) in Left 4 Dead.

Permissions = One attribute (maximum two) is assigned in which points can be placed (e.g., only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]). Additionally, a talent or specialization is determined, and the character receives the same number of points in it as in the main [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]]. The number of points a character can get is determined by their level or by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

b. Attributes = Determined by level. Points can be placed in one or a maximum of two Attributes (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2 or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 1). If an odd number of points, the first attribute gets more points. There can also be characters with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attributes.

b. Skills = The character has one [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] - but no points in skills. The number of points in talent and specialization is determined by level.

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

#### Supporting Character

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Supporting Character\|Supporting Character]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Supporting Enemy\|Supporting Enemy]]

What it is = A character that serves one or two functions in the story. They can also be a stronger version of an "unimportant character."

For example = A merchant who sells items and also gives quests to characters. Or like the strong special zombies (Witch) in Left 4 Dead.

Permissions = They can use attributes, skills, talents, and all points (e.g., wealth). These attributes, etc., are at the level required by the story. Their level of points does not change much during the story. So a poor merchant will ultimately remain poor, even if the player brings them a ton of gold.

b. Attributes = 1 point

b. Skills = 6 points

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]] or by the weapon used.

#### Important Character
[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Important Character\|Important Character]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Important Enemy\|Important Enemy]]

What it is = A character who plays a major role in the story (but not as significant as the main hero). They could be a helper, friend, or teacher of the main character.

For example = Yennefer or Marigold (Dandelion) from The Witcher series, or Legolas from The Lord of the Rings.

Permissions = All their points are at the level required by the story (this level mostly remains unchanged – for example, the poor remain poor).

Gets b. Attributes = 1 point

Gets b. Skills = 8 points

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the weapon used and specialization.

#### Main Hero
[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Main Hero\|Main Hero]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Main Enemy\|Main Enemy]]

What it is =
- A character controlled by a player,    
- or (in case of enemy) a character controlled by the narrator who does everything against the main hero controlled by the player.    

For example = Gordon Freeman, Geralt of Rivia, Sauron.

Permissions = Points can be invested in all attributes, skills. They can use all points (speed, wealth, etc.). They can do anything permitted by the narrator (or agreed upon). They might be exempt from some world or societal rules.

Gets b. Attributes = 3 points

Gets b. Skills = 12 points

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the weapon used and specialization.

#### Divine Character
[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Demi-God Character\|Demi-God Character]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/God Character\|God Character]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Uber-God Character\|Uber-God Character]]  

What it is = A character never controlled by the narrator but important to the story. This character controls other characters "behind the scenes," influences events in the world, or creates new obstacles for the characters. This character is secret and can only be met by other characters when the divine character wants them to.

- Semi-divine characters appear most frequently in the story from this group. Often as some rulers or as servants of divine characters.    
- Divine characters appear much less frequently in the story. But they are also rulers who rule over everyone and cause great change when they intervene in the story.    
- Uber-divine characters are completely hidden, characters see them only when the uber-gods want. They can make massive changes in the story.    

For example = G-Man, Zeus, [[MON\|MON]] and the like.

Permissions = They do what the story requires. These characters cannot be killed but can be defeated and disappear for some time.

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the narrator.

### Passive Character Attribute

As stated in the previous chapter, passive attributes are characteristics that "tell" whether the character is strong, average, or weak in a particular area. They are called "passive" because they are not used in dice rolls – only skills are "rolled." For instance, if a character needs to push a rock, the player does not roll for the attribute "strength ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]])", but rolls for the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]", which includes the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] (meaning they get 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] for the roll).

Unless otherwise specified, each player receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3 points\|3 points]] to allocate to any of their character's attributes. This number can vary depending on the following:

1. whether the player chooses to take a "negative" in other attributes (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] minus 1, which increases the total number of points by 1, which can then be allocated to other attributes),    
2. or if their point total is not affected by [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|Disabling Characteristic]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/perk\|perk]] (e.g., the disadvantage "missing an arm" results in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] minus 1).    

The narrator can adjust the number of points as needed for their story (e.g., superheroes will have a different number of points than a regular person).

#### List of Passive Attributes

##### Strength ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]])

Represents overall muscle strength. Strong characters can lift heavy objects or are excellent carriers (like those in the high mountains). Additionally, they have great endurance in terms of stamina (for example, they can run a marathon) and in terms of injury (they can endure many hits).

##### Reflex ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]])

Indicates how fast, flexible, and perceptive a character is. Characters with high reflexes notice many things even before other characters do. They can also react quickly and avoid potential threats.

##### Intelligence ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]])

Describes the overall wisdom of a character. High intelligence is associated with wisdom (the character can come up with good plans, recall important places in the area), good orientation (they never get lost), and skillful hands. Intelligence is also linked to spells and knowledge of magic or technology.

##### Social Skills ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]])

Indicates how a character influences others. Characters with high social skills can persuade others, empathize with their needs and emotional states (which they can then use against them).

#### What Does [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 0 Mean?

Think of attribute points in such a way that **zero** represents an average, ordinary person. Each additional point makes a person one class better in that particular attribute. If a character has a negative point in an attribute, it indicates that the character has some kind of disability.

The number of points that a player or narrator can invest in a character is limited only by the number of points available during the character creation phase. Therefore, there can be characters with STR 10 (for example, gods). However, the maximum (or rather the deepest) negatives are minus 2. Characters with attributes of minus 3 or minus 4 do not exist. Negatives should be considered as illnesses, disabilities, or disadvantages, where minus 1 is a mild disability and minus 2 is a severe disability.

##### Strength

( Negative values indicate a character who may be missing a limb, chronically ill, emaciated, or suffering from fatigue syndrome )

0. Average adult
1. Stronger person
2. Regular gym-goer
3. Competitive weightlifter
4. Olympic athlete
5. World champion weightlifter
6. Almost like Captain America

##### Reflex

( Negative values indicate a character who is clumsy – either significantly overweight, inflexible due to joint inflammation, or not very perceptive )

0. Average adult
1. More agile person
2. Amateur athlete, sports car driver, gymnast
3. Professional athlete, sports car driver, gymnast
4. Martial arts master, Olympic gymnast
5. Highest-level martial arts master, highest-level gymnast
6. Almost like Spider-Man

##### Intelligence

( Negative values indicate a character who has difficulty thinking, is clumsy with their hands, or has a neurological disorder. Alternatively, it could refer to a complete stranger in an unfamiliar world – something like E.T. the alien. )

0. Average adult
1. Smarter person
2. Teacher, scientist, artist
3. Very good scientist, artist, teacher
4. Slightly like Sherlock Holmes, intelligent enough to win a Nobel Prize
5. Sherlock Holmes, Nobel Prize winner in science
6. Almost like Megamind

##### Social Skills

( Negative values indicate a character with social phobia, sociopathy, or one who is mute. Alternatively, it could refer to a complete stranger in an alien world who doesn't understand the language – something like E.T. the alien. )

0. Average adult
1. More pleasant person
2. Someone who "knows how to deal with people" – like an advertising agency worker
3. Someone who works well with people – like a psychologist
4. High-ranking diplomat
5. World's best negotiator
6. Almost like Professor Xavier (from X-Men)

#### Bonuses of Passive Attributes

Attributes provide passive bonuses to the character when points are invested in them. However, if a character has a negative score in an attribute, they lose these passive bonuses.

* **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] adds or subtracts**

* **One point in any attribute**
    * +/- 1 to combat and magic rolls

#### Character Age 

If the narrator wishes, they can differentiate the number of points a character can allocate to their attributes based on the character's age.

- Children can allocate 0 points.    
- Adolescents can allocate 1 point.    
- Adults can allocate 2 points.    
- And older people, depending on their life experiences, can allocate up to 3 points.

### Skills in general

A skill is an activity a character performs in a story when they encounter an obstacle (e.g., locked door), a problem occurs (e.g., broken car), or when the character wants to achieve something (e.g., encrypt a message).

#### Skills and Points

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/15 points\|15 points]]** available to invest in any skill (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]]).

The maximum number of points a player can invest in each skill is limited by the narrator. Unless otherwise stated, a player can invest a maximum of 6 points in each skill.

However, a player can also take on negatives. Points can be subtracted from each skill up to a value of minus 2. That is the maximum (or minimum, rather). A skill cannot be minus 3, and certainly not minus 4.

#### Skills and Dice Rolls

The number of dice a character can use in a roll is calculated as follows:

- 3 dice as a base
- plus/minus dice for each point in the given Skill    
- plus/minus dice for each point in the Attribute that is key to the given skill    
- plus/minus dice for circumstances that may occur in the story (e.g., slippery stairs)

Only one skill can be used for each problem. However, sometimes in a story, a problem can be solved with multiple skills. In such cases, the player must choose one skill, or can choose two, but one of the two chosen skills must be rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

#### Skills and Number of Dice

For every point invested in a skill (talent or specialization), the character gets an extra die when rolling that skill.

>[!example]
 >- The character has 1 point in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]".
 >- When they roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]", they get +1 extra die.
 >- If they had 4 points in the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], they would get +4 extra dice.

#### Skills and Talent

Learn more about this topic in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]]. Here’s a brief overview.

Talent is a character’s natural ability for an activity (e.g., painting pictures), or it’s a profession or hobby. In our RPG system, it’s a supplement to skill. This means that when a character rolls dice for a skill, they can add points from their talent to that skill. This applies when the talent is needed to solve the problem (e.g., a doctor for treating deep wounds, or a mechanic for fixing an engine).

Talent is used only for solving problems or for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice rolls. Talent is not used in combat.

#### Skills and Specialization

Learn more about this topic in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|Specialization]]. Here’s a brief overview.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] is almost the same thing as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]]. However, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] differs from talent in that it’s used only in combat when the character wants to perform a particular [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]].

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] is the main skill used during [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Chase\|chases]]!

If a character wants to walk, run, or jump over difficult terrain that requires some training and the character lacks training, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. For example, when they want to walk through deep snow like in Antarctica, or through a desert, or if they have magnetic boots and are walking in zero gravity.

#### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]]

It is used to control endurance or the ability to move in unusual environments. Mobility mainly involves swimming in water, climbing rocks, rope climbing, or climbing over a fence. It also includes flying in zero gravity or in the air (like Ironman). In simple terms, it’s movement involving the whole body, not just the legs.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] also includes normal movement in relatively normal conditions. If the conditions are not normal, this skill requires a talent. Otherwise, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. (For example, swimming in a pool is different than swimming in the open sea).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] focuses on the body's defense against attacks – whether physical, chemical, bacterial, etc. If the character has a status (e.g., poison), the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] skill is used to mitigate the effect of the poison. The amount by which the character falls short of the challenge level reduces [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]], gives fewer dice for the next roll, or worsens their overall situation (e.g., unable to walk). If the character surpasses the challenge level, they mitigate the status effect (poison). The more successes they roll, the more they reduce the effect duration (e.g., poison affects for 4 rounds instead of 8). This is just an example; the narrator can adjust it.

##### All Verbs

Resistance to injury: 
Resistance, Deflection, Stopping, Defense, Protection

Resistance to external influences:

What if a blacksmith wants to forge a sword? If it's a regular blacksmith making a regular sword, they can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] If the blacksmith uses machines (like a computer-controlled lathe or something similarly complex), they use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]], because it's the machine (and not the blacksmith) making the sword.

##### Combinations with Talents

> [!example]
> * Cook - Prepares a complex dish.
> * Painter - Paints a complex picture.
> * Herbalist - for brewing potions, grinding herbs, drying, or other preparations (these preparations are similar to those in a regular kitchen).
> * Doctor - Cleans and stitches deep wounds. They know how to do it because they learned it.

### Skills Socials - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] -

Their main attribute is the attribute “Social Skills” – [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]. The number of dice (that the player or narrator can roll) is calculated as 3 dice + skill + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].

### What about other skills?

#### Swimming, Flying, Low Gravity, etc.

To control body movement in unusual materials or situations that hinder or restrict motion, special dice rolls are made. To be precise [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] (e.g., astronaut talent + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] = when floating around a space station in zero gravity).

These special movement rolls determine, whether the character drowns, falls from the sky, collides with something (in a zero-gravity environment), or executes a particular [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]] (in the unusual material) as desired. The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill overall is also used for climbing cliffs, ropes, or fences, and similar activities.

It must be specified for which material the talent can be used, as some materials are similar to each other. If rolling for a different material than what the character is specified for, the dice roll is made with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

> [!note] Categories of Material
>* Liquids (e.g., water = zero-gravity space) 
>* Empty spaces or gases (e.g., air = zero gravity = flying)
>* Granular (e.g., quicksand = snow = beans) and their storm variants (e.g., snowstorm)
>* Muddy (e.g., jelly = swamp)
>* Vertical ( napríklad skaly = tyče = laná )

#### Pilot and Ride

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] is a talent that brings the knowledge of controlling a self-moving vehicle. It is used for its control, piloting, and steering. A character with this talent can adjust their course to avoid obstacles, adjust their speed to reach the goal as soon as possible, or adjust their angle for better shooting from the vehicle.

The talent for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] is rolled in combination with the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]. Other skills can be rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|skill check]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]]. For example, the skill check [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] is rolled when a complex vehicle needs to be started, or when something breaks down in the vehicle. The skill check [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] is rolled during driving. As a check to see if the character notices an obstacle.

When a player allocates points to the talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]], they must choose which type of vehicle the talent applies to. Some vehicles are similar, so points allocated for one vehicle can also apply to another. If a player uses the talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] with a different self-moving vehicle than what the character has designated, the dice from the talent are not counted in the roll. However, the character does not roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

> [!example]  Categories of vehicles (examples)
> * Boards (e.g., skateboard = surfboard = hoverboard )
> 	* in this case it is Talent + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]
>* Personal cars (include all common personal cars)
>* Special personal cars (e.g., sports types like Ferrari, Lamborghini)
>* Vans (e.g., large and long vehicles like buses or trucks)
>* Personal airplanes (include all common planes for one or two persons)
>* Helicopters, Personal spaceships, Military spaceships, Fighters, Fighter-type spaceships, etc.

The Talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (and the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]) is used during [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Chase\|chases]] with cars, (etc.)!

> [!example] Examples of use (there can be more)
> * Piloting a spaceship, driving a car, driving a formula, riding a horse, riding a skateboard,
> * How quickly do they reach the finish line?
> * Do they dodge a bullet when an enemy tries to shoot the tires?
> * The dam breaks, and the character jumps onto a floating tree (which at that moment "turns" into a surfboard)

> [!note]
> - When it comes to flying, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] is used when the device (or wings) are part of the character's body and the character uses their body for direct control (e.g., Ironman, angel, or hang glider).
> - In combination with the talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (and the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]), flying is used when the device is not part of the body and the pilot boards the machine (e.g., into a fighter jet, or helicopter).

#### Healing Wounds

The skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]” is used for healing wounds. If they are deep wounds, infected, or otherwise complicated, the character must have a talent designated for healing (for example, doctor, herbalist, etc.).

For “healing the wounds of a mechanical being,” the skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]” is rolled. The same applies as above - for more complex repairs, the character must have a talent.

#### Navigation

Navigation talent is included in talents such as taxi driver, navigator, sailor, hunter, or city thief. Navigation (or orientation) is rolled as a combination of talent + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]. (for example, taxi driver + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] = when wanting to find a shortcut). This talent works similarly to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], but is focused on spatial orientation, in the landscape, on the planet, or in space. The character has a kind of compass inside them, which helps them know where to go. They know how to read maps, recognize landmarks, navigate a ship by stars, or track (e.g., when hunting an animal).

Navigation (or orientation) is used to find the shortest path if the character wants to avoid an enemy. It is also used in cases where the character wants to find food (e.g., hunt a deer and knows where the pastures are), or when they want to find a plant for a potion.

#### Survival

Survival is the character's ability to survive in the wilderness. Characters can use it for various tasks, such as finding food and water, building a shelter, or even healing injuries.

When rolling dice, a combination of skill and talent is used. For example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] with the talent hunter can be used to find a deer, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] with the talent mushroom picker for finding edible mushrooms, or the talent adventurer with the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] skill to build a shelter.

#### Talking to Animals / Animal Control

A character can talk to animals (like other characters) only if they have a special talent (or know some magic).

To control an animal (any animal of a particular kind), the character needs a talent (e.g., dog trainer, police dog handler, cat lover, tiger breeder). When the character needs the animal to do something: Talent + skill from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] is rolled, against the challenge level required to control the animal (CL = animal's level).

This roll is made against challenge level 3. However, this level is influenced by the animal's nature, training, or mood. And of course, whether the character wants to scare the animal away or “convince” it to bring something. The narrator determines the level of the challenge. The following list can also help.

- Domestication    
    - wild animals increase the challenge by 1        
    - domesticated animals decrease the challenge by 1        
- Nature    
    - aggressive animals have increased challenge by 1        
    - friendly animals have decreased challenge by 1        
- Intelligence    
    - animals that are less intelligent have increased challenge by 1        
    - animals that are intelligent have decreased challenge by 1        
- Relationship to Humans    
    - animals that have been hurt by humans have increased challenge by 2        
    - animals that do not know humans have increased challenge by 1        
    - animals that know humans but have no special relationship with them (e.g., farm cows) have no change in challenge level
    - animals with a good relationship reduce the challenge by 1 or 2, depending on their relationship with humans.        
- and so on.

##### SOC Skills with Animals and Helpers

- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intuition\|Intuition]]: For example, when the character wants to find out how the animal is doing mentally, wants to discover what might scare the animal, or wants to know who the leader in the group is.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]: 90% of rolls. The character tells the animal what to do (literally persuading it).    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]: The character wants to deceive the animal, for example, pretending to be dead so the animal doesn’t eat them.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intimidation\|Intimidation]]: For example, scaring the animal away, or if the animal wants to eat something and the character wants to forbid it.

#### Encryption

When one character talks to another and doesn’t want anyone to know what they are talking about, a combination of Talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] skill is used. The same applies to writing. However, if they write a message and use a computer (or other device) to _encrypt_ it, a combination of Talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] skill is used, with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] being used as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|self-assistance roll]].

To _decrypt_ a message, Talent and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intuition\|Intuition]] (if it is a text that can be normally read) or, for an encrypted file, Talent and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] is used.

#### Throwing Objects

A character wants to throw a stone at an enemy, throw a rope to an ally, or throw a large stone at a group of enemies. They can use these skills:

* When they want to throw something heavy and don’t need to aim precisely = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] is used
* When they want to throw something secretly so that no one notices = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] is used
* When they want to deceive someone that they threw something = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] is used
* When they want to throw something precisely = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] is used.

#### Lockpicking

When a character wants to unlock a lock without keys (with a lockpick), they can use the following skills:

* When it’s a common lock and they want to unlock it quickly = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] is used
* When it’s a complex lock with various mechanisms or is being opened with a device = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] is used
* When they want to break the lock with their hands = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] is used
* The skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]” can also be used to unlock a lock, but it will take twice as long (or the challenge level will be +2)

#### Music and Art

- When playing musical instruments, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] skill is used.
- When painting pictures or creating sculptures, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] skill is used.
- When singing, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] skill is used.
- When acting, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] skill is used.

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/03-character/attributes-skills-talent/rpg-talent/#talent" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



### Talent

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is a natural aptitude for some activity that a character possesses (e.g., being a skilled painter), or it could be something the character has studied (e.g., electrical engineering), a profession (e.g., cook, programmer, healer), or a hobby (e.g., amateur detective). Talent can also be magic (e.g., school of fire, demon summoner, potion master), a superpower (e.g., spider-man, laser eyes, mega strength), or a type of martial art (e.g., boxer, samurai).

Talent indicates the character's primary occupation, their role in the group, or what they are genuinely good at. In video games, the term talent could be equivalent to a class (e.g., ranger, necromancer), a type (e.g., tank, support), or a designation (e.g., healer).

Each character must have at least one talent and can have a maximum of 6 talents. Unless otherwise specified, each player receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/15 points\|15 points]] during character creation to allocate to any skills, talents, or specializations. For every point invested in a talent, the character gains one extra die when performing an activity that requires that talent (e.g., an auto mechanic talent when repairing an engine).

Unless stated otherwise, a player can invest a maximum of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] in each talent. The number of invested points is assessed similarly to attributes or skills (where 0 means an average person and 3 indicates someone very capable).

> [!example]
>* chef 1 = slightly better chef (+ 1 die)
>* chef 2 = good chef (+ 2 dice)
>* chef 3 = great chef (+ 3 dice)
>* chef 4 = excellent chef (+ 4 dice)
>* and so on

If a character has a negative score in a talent (e.g., cook minus 2), they lose points from their dice roll. However, they can still perform specialized activities and, in most cases, prefer doing those activities (like someone who loves to cook, but the food isn't edible).

> [!example]
>* cook minus 1 = really bad cook ( minus 1 die )
>* cook minus 2 = dangerously incompetent cook ( minus 2 dice )

#### Talent and Skills

Talents work as an enhancement to skills. This means that when a character rolls dice for a skill, they can add points from their talent to that skill. However, this only applies when solving a problem requiring education or specific knowledge.

> [!example]
> - A character digs up a crystal and wants to know if it's a diamond or something else.
> - The narrator tells them to roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]].
><br>
> - The character has the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] Geology.
> <br>
> - Therefore, their roll includes: 3 base dice + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] + Geology.

When a character needs to do something that requires education or special knowledge, and they don't have this education or knowledge (i.e., talent), they roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the activity is magical, very special, or very difficult (even for someone with an education), they roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|great disadvantage]].

> [!example]
> - A character wants to hack into a government computer network. However, they don't have a talent that can be used for hacking. Therefore, they will roll with great disadvantage.
><br>
> - A player wants to brew a potion. However, their character doesn't have a talent that can be used for potion making. Therefore, they will roll with great disadvantage (since it involves magic).
> <br>
> - A player wants to steal a car. However, their character doesn't know how to drive. Therefore, they will roll with disadvantage.

Each talent must specify when it can be used, in what activities, circumstances, and situations. For example, if a character is a Cook and wants to defuse a bomb, they cannot use the Cook skill. They need a talent for defusing bombs, such as - Bomb Technician.

Additionally, talents cannot be combined. One talent cannot enhance another talent, and two talents cannot enhance a single skill. When a situation in the story arises that would allow the use of two suitable talents - the character must choose one.

However, each use of a talent must be approved by the narrator. The narrator determines whether the combination (talent + skill) can be used. This depends on the specific situation in the game (for example, when the character is looking for medicines, they can use the Doctor talent).

####  Talent and Combat

Talent is used for solving problems, not for combat. Only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] is used in combat. Specialization can be combined with other skills during combat. You can find more details in the chapters "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]]" and "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|Combat Maneuvers]]."

Regarding talent and combat, if a character has a talent applicable to a specific type of weapon or fighting style, the character rolls a combat roll but does not gain any extra dice from the talent, as only specialization increases the number of dice in a combat roll.

However, if the character does not have an appropriate talent for their weapon (or martial art) and does not have a specialization, their combat roll is made with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. For very complex weapons or under very difficult circumstances, they roll with great disadvantage.

### Specialization

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] is similar to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]]. However, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] is used exclusively for combat.

A character can add a specialization for a specific weapon, a certain martial art, a particular armor, or a specific branch of magic to their character sheet. Each character can have a maximum of 3 specializations.

Unless otherwise specified, each player receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/15 points\|15 points]] during character creation to allocate to any skills, talents, or specializations. Unless stated otherwise, a player can invest a maximum of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] in each specialization. The number of invested points is assessed similarly to attributes or skills (where 0 means an average person and 3 indicates someone very capable).

If a character wants to assign a specialization for a specific weapon or magic (etc.), they just need to write it down in the list of talents and assign points to it (e.g., medium-sized swords 2).

#### Specialization and Skills

Specialization is used exclusively for combat. It can be combined with skills when the character wants to perform a specific [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]] during combat. Specialization cannot be used with skills when solving problems in the story. Only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is used for that.

When a character needs to do something that requires education or special knowledge, and the character does not have this knowledge or education (i.e., specialization), they roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

When it is an activity that is very special or very difficult (even for someone with education) and the character does not have this knowledge (i.e., specialization), they roll with [[great disadvantage\|great disadvantage]].

#### Specialization and Weapons

Specialization in weapons increases the number of dice in a combat roll when the character uses that weapon. It also increases the maximum damage that the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]] can deal to an enemy.

If the character does not have the appropriate talent for their weapon (or martial art) and does not have the specialization, their combat roll is made with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. For very complex weapons or under very difficult circumstances, they roll with great disadvantage
 
#### Specialization and Armor

Specialization in armor increases the number of armor points when the character is wearing that specific type of armor. For example, with Samurai Armor Specialization 1, the character gains +1 armor point when wearing samurai armor.

However, there is an additional restriction for armor specialization. The character must have their entire body covered by a single type of armor – they cannot wear two or three types of armor. This is because they will not receive any benefits from the specialization

> [!note] 
> If the character, for example, wears samurai gloves and boots, but a different type of helmet, the points invested in the specialization will not count. They will be considered as having no armor specialization. 

Armor specialization must be tied to a profession, type of martial art, or certain magic. The character cannot have a specialization in light armors (i.e., light armors of all kinds) – it must specify the type, for example, light samurai armor.

#### Specialization and Magic

### Change in Attributes and Skills

#### Point Transfer

Every character develops during the story. Some may become stronger, others may weaken, or they may gain new experiences. This story development is captured in the game through the so-called point transfer. Each character can transfer 1 point from any attribute to any other Attribute. This transfer is allowed only once every two played (story) years. Regarding [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skills]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specializations]], a character can transfer 1 point from any Skill to any other Skill, Talent, or Specialization, only once every 2 weeks.

Points can also be transferred such that an Attribute, Skill, or Talent reaches a value below 0. However, this requires the narrator's consent. (This does not apply to specializations).

> [!example]
> The word “Spell” includes: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|magic]], special aptitude, abilities, superpowers, or sci-fi technologies. We use the word “Spell” or the word “Magic” when we do not want to list all the abilities.

#### Increasing Attribute and Skill Points

A character can temporarily increase their attributes or Skills, for example, with the help of a Spell or by purchasing a better weapon (or tool). Additionally, our RPG system offers the possibility of permanent improvement. A character can permanently increase their Attributes and Skills by receiving 1 point from the narrator (which can be invested in an attribute or skill) directly, or by the character [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Training\|training]].

##### 1 point from the narrator

When characters complete a task given to them by the narrator, they can earn 1 point. The narrator decides whether this point can be added to their Attributes, Skills, Talents, or Specializations. However, it is usually a point for Skills (and so on), as 1 point for Attributes requires much greater effort or a much longer period.

>[!example]
>In the story of The Lord of the Rings, Frodo and Sam reached Mount Doom after a long and arduous journey and destroyed the ring. On their journey, they would receive 2 points in Attributes.

The narrator can decide to give the characters multiple tasks—one main and several side tasks—and upon completion of these tasks, the narrator can also give some additional reward. (More about tasks is in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]])

### Enabling characteristics

Some characters may have an enhancement that gives them an advantage. This can be a health-related, psychological, or social advantage. Alternatively, a character may excel in something or be particularly successful in a specific area. In our RPG system, all of these aspects are represented by a mechanic called [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]].

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]] is a set of traits that give a character an advantage. They enhance them in some way or help them handle situations that come their way (narrator). Advantages are given to characters to make them interesting. This mechanic, of course, also impacts gameplay (adding or subtracting points) and the story (players portray their character according to their disadvantage, like actors in a film).

A player can take a maximum of **2 Advantages**, each of which must be approved by the narrator and may also be modified if necessary. If the story (and the narrator) permits, an advantage can also be removed over time.

#### How to create an advantage

Below in this text is a list of advantages we have prepared for you. But if you want to create your own, you can proceed as follows.:

##### Impact on the story

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|Enabling characteristics]] must improve a character in some way or help them overcome an obstacle. Therefore, they should be chosen based on what is in the story. If it is a story with magic, the character may have some kind of talent for magic (especially the most common one).

Sometimes a character may need to activate their ability. When the character reaches a place where there is an obstacle (such as when a character knows how to work with cats and is faced with a guard who is a cat), they must roll the dice against the difficulty level. If the character overcomes the difficulty, the ability is activated. If the character fails the dice roll, something bad will happen, or nothing will happen (the ability will not be activated).

If a character wants to activate their ability, they must roll a skill, or they can roll all attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]) without a skill.

##### Impact on Points

The character loses as many points (for skills, talents, or specializations) as the chosen advantage adds. However, for each advantage, every character loses some points (those for skills, talents, and specializations). Additionally, the character loses extra points for each added point to a skill or talent (the list is copied from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]).


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/04-points/rpg-points-of-wealth/#item-price" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

> [!example] 
>- The character loves the smell of chemicals.
>- In an environment with a strange chemical odor that stings the eyes, the character gets 2 extra dice.
>- When creating the character, 2 points are deducted, which could have been invested in skills or talents.

#### List of Enabling characteristics

This list was created for the [[LOREGENT/Assets/References/Systems/Open D6 - System\|Open D6 - System]]. If a player cannot choose from the list, they can roll a random die and select from the following table:

|     |       1 - 2        |            3 - 4             |     5 - 6     |

##### Column - 1, 2 -

###### Item 1 - Authority :

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character is a superior or part of security forces (such as police officers, firefighters, etc.). Therefore, everyone must obey them.        
    - Authority also gives the character other options - for example, as a police officer, they can declare a search or activate police lights to get somewhere quickly.      
    - The character must choose one Talent that will serve as their main occupation, through which they gain this authority.       
    - They must invest at least 3 points into this talent.        
    - Whenever the character wants to use the advantage of their authority, they must roll skill + talent dice against the difficulty determined by the narrator.        
    - Failure in the dice roll is explained in the story, for example, by the radio failing, the person not understanding or paying attention, or the operator not finding the place the character was looking for on the map.

    - However, this "everything" is not entirely free. Although the character is paid or has some advantages, they must deliver results to their patron. For example, if they go to a temple in the jungle, they must bring back an artifact. Or they must engage in some research.        
    - The character is obligated to their patron, but this does not restrict them much. They just need to deliver the results. The patron does not care how they do it.        
- **Change**:    
    - The character gets their equipment for free.        
    - Or they get an additional 100 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]. They can get more, depending on the narrator. The character must complete a task for the patron.        
    - Or the character can have some small tasks, and when they complete them, they get 50 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] for each task.

    - The character is assigned one or more related things against which they will be brave.        
- **Change**:    
    - (Status) Courage: When the character is near something that others fear (or find unpleasant), they get +2 dice to their roll.

##### Column - 3, 4 -

###### Item 1 - Contacts:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character knows someone who could help or someone who can find out something. It could also be a group of hired heroes or workers.        
    - These services are not free, even though ordinary characters cannot access these things at all.        
    - To determine the quality of the service, luck is rolled. Contacts always fulfill what the character wants from them. But in case of bad luck, it can be more expensive, take longer, or not be without some problems (for example, the character has to break into somewhere).    
- **Points**:    
    - The character loses 3 points that could have been invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

###### Item 2 - Tools:

- **Explanation**:

- **Change**:    
    - Attributes: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] (intelligence): +1        
- **Points**:    
    - The character loses 4 points that could have been invested in other skills, talents, or specializations

###### Item 5 - Persuasive:

- **Explanation**:

- **Change**:    
    - (Status) Unfooled: The character cannot fail when defending against [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] skills. Failure in the roll means a tie.        
    - The character must invest 3 points into the Skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]].        
- **Points**:    
    - The character loses 3 points that could have been invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

###### Item 6 - Disadvantage Hides Advantage:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character has some [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|disadvantage]]. BUT this disadvantage has a small advantage that they can use.        
    - For example, if they have the disadvantage of "cultural ignorance," other characters might consider them harmless. Therefore, they can get into places they normally wouldn't. Or if they don't know the language, people might talk about secret things in front of them. The character doesn't understand, but they might have a recording device.        
- **Points**:    
    - The character loses 3 points that could have been invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

##### Column - 5, 6 -

###### Item 1 - Guardian:

- **Explanation**:    
    - Someone is secretly watching over the character from a distance, and whenever something bad is about to happen to the character, they intervene. This guardian angel has a mission to help the character fulfill their mission. The guardian can solve a problem or save the character from death.        
    - The guardian is controlled by the narrator, who can roll a luck die to determine when the guardian arrives and what they resolve. (For example, they might arrive just before the end of a fight or simply lead the character out of a fire). The higher the number, the more they do or the sooner they arrive.        
- **Points**:    
    - The character loses 3 points that could have been invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

### Disabling Characteristic

Every character has some sort of problem that puts them at a disadvantage. Every character has their own difficulties, whether health-related, psychological, or social. Or a character might be bad at something or just not good at something. All these mentioned difficulties are manifested in our RPG system by a mechanic called "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|Disabling Characteristic]]."

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|Disabling Characteristic]] is a set of traits that put the character at a disadvantage. It limits them in some way, making it difficult for them to solve situations that the story (narrator) throws their way. Disadvantages are given to characters to make them interesting. This mechanic, of course, also affects gameplay (adding or subtracting points) and the story (players play their character according to their disadvantage, like actors in a film).

A character can have a maximum of **2 disadvantages**, each of which must be approved by the narrator and possibly adjusted. If the story (and narrator) allows it, the disadvantage can be erased over time.

#### How to Create a Disadvantage

Below is a list of pre-made disadvantages for you. But if you want to create your own, follow these steps:

##### Impact on the Story

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|Disabling Characteristic]] should create a significant obstacle for the character. It should be chosen based on what’s in the story. If it’s a story with magic, the character might have an allergy to a particular type of magic (especially the most common one).

When the character encounters an obstacle (e.g., phobia of cats and enters a cat café), they must roll dice against the challenge level. If the character overcomes the challenge, nothing bad happens. If they fail the roll, something negative occurs (what happens must be specified for the disadvantage. For example, with a cat phobia, the character might flee or go into a frenzy trying to kill all the cats).

If the character wants to overcome the obstacle (e.g., phobia of cats), they must roll a skill or can roll all attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]) without a skill.

##### Impact on Points

For each disadvantage, the character gets a few extra points, which they can invest in other skills, talents, or specializations. Additional "skill" points can be gained for each point taken by the disadvantage (e.g., if they have a disadvantage giving -2 to the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], they add +2 points.). The point cost is determined by the rules on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]].

### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] refer to the amount of money a character carries. The number is determined by the narrator, and unless stated otherwise, every character receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6]]0 wealth points at the beginning of the game. These points can be increased when the character invests in the attribute [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] and can further be increased by selling, stealing, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward\|completing tasks]].

#### How much money should the character receive?

At the beginning of the story, each character receives a certain amount of money. Below is a list of wealth levels. The narrator determines the character's wealth level according to this list.

- Homeless: (0 - 10)
- Low-income: (11 - 20)
- Average income: (21 - 40)
- Good income: (41 - 80)
- Upper class: (81 - 160)
- High class: (161 - 320)
- Wealthier: (321 - 640)
- Rich: (641 - 1,280)
- Very rich: (1,281 - 2,560)
- Extra rich: (2,561 - 5,120)

If the narrator can't decide how much money a character should receive, they can roll dice, for example, when characters meet a wandering merchant. The number rolled on the dice is multiplied by 10 to determine how much money the other character (such as the wandering merchant) has. If it’s a very wealthy character, the narrator can roll multiple dice.

#### Consumption of wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] (p.w.) in our system are considered as money, such as euros, coins, credits. This is because they are spent in the same way as those mentioned euros, coins, credits. So if something costs, for example, 10 p.w. and the character has 30 p.w. in their pockets, after purchasing the item, the character will have only 20 p.w. left.

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

##### For Example

> [!example]
>- Leather armor, which adds 3 points of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor\|armor]] -> price 6
>- Long axe, which increases max damage by 2 -> price 4
>-  Bandage, which adds 3 dice to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Liečenie zranenia\|natural regeneration]] -> price 3
>- Healing potion, which immediately adds 2 health points -> price 8

##### Quality and Price

If the narrator wants, they can adjust the final price according to the quality or rarity. If the item is rare or of higher quality, the price increases. And if the item is damaged, or is something abundant (like sand in the desert), the price decreases.

- Trash - 16 p.w.
- Horrible / Damaged - 8 p.w.
- Bad / Very abundant item - 4 p.w.
- Worse / Abundant item - 2 p.w.
- Normal + 0 p.w. (base for all items)
- Better / Unusual + 2 p.w.
- Quality / Exceptional + 4 p.w.
- Good / Rare + 8 p.w.
- Very rare + 16 p.w.

##### Merchant Markup

The final price can also be increased by the merchant's markup. To determine it, one, two, or three dice are used (depending on how much the merchant wants to earn). The narrator rolls the dice and the value rolled:

- is added up and added to the final price of the item (when the character buys from the merchant),
- or subtracted from the final price (when the character sells something to the merchant).

#### Price in the Story

When a character wants to buy a room in a hotel, sell a car, or buy a beer—how much will they pay? The narrator can decide how to proceed.

##### First Option

The first option is that the price of an item or service is determined by the number of points (dice, or attributes) a character receives. For example, when a character rents a room in a hotel, they do so to rest and thus restore their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. The price will reflect the number of points the character restores. If it is an item that brings some benefit to the character (for example, a nice shirt adds dice to the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] skill), the number of points (or dice) the item brings to the character determines the final price.

##### Second Option

The second option is that the price is determined according to the scale:

- Cheap: 1 - 5
- Common: 5 - 9
- Pricier: 10 - 14
- Expensive: 15 - 19
- and so on

##### Third Option

The third option is that the narrator looks up the price of an item in our real world, divides it by 30, and rounds up. The minimum price of an item is always 1 p.w.

>[!example]
>A new car costs 22,000 €, so the price should be around 733 p.w.

Of course, the same applies as above. If an item or service is rare (or common) in the given world, the narrator can adjust the price of the service (see section [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Quality and Price\|Quality and Price]]).

#### Earning points of Wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] increase when a character sells something, completes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Body za splnenie príbehovej úlohy\|a task]], receives a reward for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Prvá možnosť Body podľa úrovne nepriateľov\|defeating an enemy]], or performs a job. They receive their money directly from other characters. The money is added just like during consumption. So if a character has 20 p.w. and sells an item for 30, they will have 50 p.w.

#### Negotiating Prices with a Merchant

The price of an item in a shop can be lowered or increased in favor of the character. To do this, any [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used, rolled as an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active conflict]] against any of the merchant's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute. The price with the merchant can also be changed through simple conversation, or the character can solve the merchant's problem.

If a character decides they want to negotiate the price with the merchant, they choose the skill they will use (any from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used) and state how much they want to adjust the price in their favor (e.g., lower the price when buying, or increase the price when selling). For each point the character changes their price, the merchant gets that many wins added to their roll. This number is divided by 2.

> [!example] 
> For example, a character wants to change the price (in their favor) by 
> 
> 1 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 2 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 3 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 4 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 5 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 6 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 
> and so on

> [!example]
> - A character wants to buy an axe that costs 6.
> - The character wants to lower the price by 4 points.
> - The merchant gets 2 wins in their roll.

- When the price negotiation is won by the character, the price is adjusted by the amount they wanted.
- When the price negotiation is won by the merchant, the price is adjusted unfavorably for the character by the number of additional wins the merchant rolled. These wins are then multiplied by 5.

> [!example] (...continuing from the previous example)
> - The character rolled 4 wins
> - The merchant rolled 3 wins + 2 that they received
> - The merchant, therefore, rolled 1 more win than the character
> <br>
> - If the character wanted to buy the item, its price increases by 5 points
> - If the character wanted to sell the item, its price decreases by 5 points

Price negotiation can only be rolled once.

##### Column - 1 -

###### Item 1 - Advantage hides disadvantage:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character has an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Enabling characteristics\|advantage]], but that advantage comes with a significant downside. It’s a catch that makes using that advantage unpleasant. The narrator decides which advantage it applies to.        
    - For example, the character has a powerful weapon BUT very little ammunition. The character has telepathic abilities BUT using them causes migraines for others. Someone can help the character BUT they have a contagious airborne disease, or the character must cleanse themselves because they bear some societal sin.        
- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

###### Item 2 - Incompatibility with atmosphere:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character is sensitive to something that normally occurs in the air of the given world. They must protect themselves against it.

- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Poison: The character loses 0.5 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health points]] per round.

When a problem arises, the character is the first to volunteer to solve it, and they may only fail.

###### Item 6 - Nutritional need:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character must eat to survive or avoid weakness, but it’s something that people don’t normally eat. This thing is considered evil, unclean, or demonic – and everyone condemns the character for it (or it must be kept secret, or they'll be killed). It could be blood, human flesh, etc. The character loses 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|energy]] point every day. Whenever they eat, they regain all [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]].

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 2 - Kleptomania:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character feels the need to steal something. It doesn’t matter what the item's value or significance is. Most items kleptomaniacs steal are useless and not highly valued. They’re mainly after the thrill – the excitement of possibly getting caught or successfully stealing something right under someone’s nose.        
    - When the narrator decides, the character must roll all attributes against a challenge level determined by the narrator. If they fail, the character must steal something (a luck die is rolled to determine what exactly – but something in the vicinity).        
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Not Trusted: Those who know this character are aware they steal. Hence, they don’t let them into stores or always keep an eye on them. With this status, the character gets -3 to the skill [Stealth].

###### Item 3 - Can't Lie:

- **Explanation**:    
    - This character can't lie, either to everyone or only to certain groups of people (e.g., only to women, or only to their boss). This character always answers when asked. This, of course, doesn’t mean they can’t just tell part of the truth.        
        - For example: Did you fix the hose on the engine?            
        - Yes. (but the engine still doesn’t work)

    - No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 4 - Procrastination:

- **Explanation**:    
    - If there’s a simpler and more enjoyable option, the character will take it. For example, instead of studying, they’ll play video games. The character then feels depressed about not controlling themselves and not doing what they were supposed to. The type of procrastination is determined by the narrator. If the character has something to do, and there are video games nearby, they must maintain focus by rolling all attributes against a challenge level set by the narrator. If they fail, they have to play or lose 3 dice on each roll until they do.        
- **Change**:    
    - Trait: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Needs\|Needs]]: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character psyché/Gluttony\|Gluttony]]

- **Change**:

    - During the game, the narrator can roll for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|luck]] to see if the enemies happen to appear.

- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Flee: When the character is close to the source of their phobia (or thinks they are), they must roll all attributes against a challenge level set by the narrator. If they fail, they run away – far away.

    - The character must pay interest every month. Each time they pay the interest, they lose 40 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]. If they don’t pay, they receive a severe punishment.

	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 2 - Nihilism:

- **Explanation**:
	- The character believes there’s no point in resisting things that will happen anyway. They are sad, passive, and talk about death as if they were talking about candy. This doesn't mean they don’t do what they have to; rather, they see no point and don’t give it their all. They always see the world as it is. They can’t be given hope or deceived into thinking things will get better. 
	    - We’re all going to die one day, so why resist?        
	    - It's futile to strive to change these circumstances.
	    - All religions lie, and nothing really has meaning.
- **Change**:

	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 3 - Big Child:

- - **Explanation**:    
    - The character is naive, believes everything everyone says or only believes specific people, like their father. They can’t maintain focus for long, are sensitive to cold, fatigue, etc., and whine if their needs aren’t met (e.g., they want to sleep but have to guard the stupid fire).        
    - They do things their own way (even if they’re supposed to watch the fire, they will sleep “just because”).        
    - They act spitefully towards others if they’re upset and choose friends or enemies based on superficial traits (e.g., he raised his voice at me because the fire went out, so I’m not friends with him).        
    - It’s essentially a spoiled child.        
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Childish: When the narrator says, the character must roll all attributes against a challenge level set by the narrator. If they fail, the character behaves childishly or completely contrary to what other characters want.

	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 4 - Illness:

- **Explanation**:    
	- The character suffers from a chronic illness that doesn’t kill them but significantly complicates their life.
- **Change**:
	- (Status): Illness: When the narrator says, the character must roll {{Endurance}} against a difficulty of 3 to determine if they need to take a crucial medication. If they need the medication and don't take it within an hour, their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] decrease by 1 (no more) and will continue to decrease by 1 each hour until they take the medication. Once they take the medication, only 1 health point is restored. Other health points must be restored through [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health\|healing]].

	- No points can be added to negative skills.

###### Item 5 - Liar:

- **Explanation**:    
    - This character lies almost all the time, but they shouldn't lie _about everything_ to the point where it’s impossible to maintain a normal conversation or collaboration.        
    - The lies should be about their achievements or things they found. They might say they found a gold coin on the ground or make up amazing stories about how they defeated a dragon—even though they were the first to run away.        
- **Change**:    
    - (Status): Not Trusted: Characters who know this character know they’re lying. Therefore, they lose 3 dice from all [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] skills.        
    - (Status): Lie: When the narrator says, the character must roll all attributes against a challenge level set by the narrator. If they fail, they must lie.

    - The character gets 1 bonus point.        
    - Points gained from negatives can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

###### Item 6 - Employment:

- **Explanation**:    
    - The character has a job that requires time, focus, and energy. Therefore, they can't go on adventures “just like that” and must also work.        
    - Alternatively, the expedition the character is on is part of their job and has a strict schedule they must follow. They must bring results, or else they don’t get paid. The character has very limited time.        
    - For example, they might only be free after 5 PM and need to go to bed by 8 PM to get up at 5 AM, or they might need to be somewhere to analyze data or conduct excavations.        
    - The character receives a salary of 5 wealth points per week or may not have to pay some fees because the company they work for covers them.        
- **Points**:    
    - The character gets 3 extra points, which can be invested in other skills, talents, or specializations.

### Perk

Some characters may have innate special traits, talents, or skills that set them apart from others. These traits, known as "perks," are free for the characters. However, their effects are limited to special cases, and some traits may also have drawbacks. A character can choose only one innate trait, and the trait (and its corresponding disadvantage) must be approved by the narrator. The trait is listed among talents in the character's table.

> [!example]
> **Cat Person**: When in darkness (where a normal person can't see), they get +2 dice on a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill roll. However, such a character is sensitive to light and loses 2 dice on a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] roll in strong light (e.g., sharp sunlight at noon).
> 
> **Fish Person**: +3 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] when swimming in water. On land, they lose 2 dice from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] if they don't drink water (let’s say they need 1 liter every 3 hours).
> 
> **Bear**: +2 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]], -2 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]].

#### Powerful Traits

A powerful trait (or Keystone) is an attribute of a character that changes the whole game for that specific character. It can make certain RPG rules not apply to the character or work in entirely different ways. Each powerful trait must have both advantages and disadvantages, balanced accordingly. However, not every powerful trait must have a level. Below is a list serving as inspiration for the narrator, who can create any powerful traits they desire.

A powerful trait, like other traits or blessings, is listed among talents in the character's table.

##### Perfect

**Description**: 
The character rolls one die. If they roll a success (4, 5, 6), their success will be perfect (as if they rolled 7 successes with 7 dice plus some extra benefit). If they roll a failure (3, 2, 1), their failure will also be perfect (as if they rolled only failures plus some extra drawback).

**Levels**: 
The level affects the range of numbers when this powerful trait activates. If different numbers are rolled (outside the range), the character must roll their normal skill check.

1: The activation range is only 6 and 1 (6 as a perfect success, 1 as the worst failure). 
2: The activation range is 6, 5, 2, and 1. 
3: The activation range is 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. 
4: The activation range is 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. The character rolls two dice and chooses the one with the better result.

##### Free

**Description**: 
The character is free. Gravity doesn’t hold them down, they don’t need to eat, and they don’t feel pain. They are released from everything and just float around. Nothing can stop them—they are like an indestructible ghost that doesn't even have HP. On the flip side, they can’t fight because they can’t hit anything. They also can’t complete tasks because they can’t touch anything.

**Levels**: 
The level affects when the character is free. For example, at the lowest level, they will be free only at night. At the highest level, they will always be free. The highest level also allows the character to choose when they will be free.

##### Powerful
(no levels)

**Description**: 
The character is extremely strong. They can break through anything, crush anything, tear anything apart, all with ease as if everything were made of butter. However, the character lacks fine motor skills—any delicate work they attempt will be ruined because they handle everything with full force.

In every roll involving the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] attribute (or in any situation where they use their strength), they get +4 successes. However, with every roll, they will break, damage, or injure someone.

##### Guru
(no levels)

**Description**:
For this character, money is worthless, and so they don’t use it. Instead, they live spiritually and in the present.

This character cannot use money. They can't sell or buy anything, nor can they help with selling or buying. All wealth points are converted into skill points (4 skill points per 10 wealth points) or attribute points (1 attribute point per 10 wealth points). The character can pay for services by rolling SOC (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]) to give some life advice to the merchant.

The character can only pay for services through bartering or exchanging a service for a service (e.g., "I’ll peel your potatoes in exchange for a place to sleep under the stairs"). The character always demands the lowest quality (or a basic item) but tries to do as much as possible for the other person.

Price = challenge level. If they fail, the quality of the service (or item) decreases, or they receive no service at all and only get scolded instead.

##### Balanced
(no levels)

**Description**: 
Whenever the character succeeds (or fails) in a skill, or whenever they win (or lose) a conflict, this trait activates.

When the character succeeds or wins, failure points are added. Similarly, when the character fails or loses, success points are added.

Success points or failure points must be exchanged for successes or failures in any dice roll. If the character does not do this and accumulates 5 success points (or failure points), then for the next 5 dice rolls, they will roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. During this curse, the character does not gain any points.

##### Metroidvania
(levels up as the story progresses)

**Description**: 
This character has armor and weapons that gradually improve. They do so by finding a shrine of an ancient and advanced civilization or by defeating a powerful boss and absorbing its energy.

##### Jinx
(no levels)

**Description**: 
Anything the character touches breaks, and anything that touches the character also breaks. This means the character can only fail or break something. If they manage to pass a difficulty level, they break the object in such a way that it becomes useful or harmless. On the other hand, if a weapon harms the character, the weapon is damaged, or if it tries to target the character, it gets jammed.

##### Average
(no levels)

**Description**: 
This character is average in everything. Everything they do succeeds "averagely." This means they can never fail. They can fix or start things, but if they fail a roll (don't meet the difficulty level), it just extends the time needed for the repair, activation, or other tasks. This powerful trait only applies to skills and not to combat. On the other hand, the character doesn't have any skill points. They can put 1 point into talents or spells. Attributes are not affected by this powerful trait.

##### Protector
(no levels)

**Description**: 
When this character takes damage in combat while protecting someone or when they take damage on behalf of someone else (e.g., they throw themselves in front of a friendly character and get shot by an enemy), their injuries heal at the end of the battle at a rate of +1 health point per hour. However, if this character injures someone (i.e., directly attacks and causes damage), they receive equivalent damage in return.

#### Powerful Traits for Items

In addition to characters, items can also have powerful traits. In other games, this is known as the suffix-prefix system.

>[!example]
>Sword of Speed, Mighty Katana of the Sun, Boots of Endurance

The narrator simply assigns such an item an advantage and a disadvantage. 

>[!example]
>- Sword of Precision
>	- Advantage: The sword contains 2 points that can be exchanged for a success. These points are replenished after each battle.
>	- Disadvantage: The sword decreases the character's attack by 2.

The price of such an item does not need to change if it has a disadvantage of equal value. Otherwise, if it has a smaller disadvantage or no disadvantage at all, each point (which gives an advantage) is multiplied by 4.

>[!example]
>- Sword of Precision
>	- Standard: Attack +2
>	- Advantage: The sword contains 2 points that can be exchanged for a success. These points are replenished after each battle.
>	- Disadvantage: (none)
>- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Cena predmetu\|Price]] : 12 
><br>
>- Sword of Precision
>	- Standard: Attack +2
>	- Advantage: The sword contains 2 points that can be exchanged for a success. These points are replenished after each battle.
>	- Disadvantage: The sword decreases the character's attack by 1 (instead of -2)
>- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Cena predmetu\|Price]] : 8
><br>
>- Sword of Precision
>	- Standard: Attack +2
>	- Advantage: The sword contains 2 points that can be exchanged for a success. These points are replenished after each battle.
>	- Disadvantage: The sword decreases the character's attack by minus 2
>- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Cena predmetu\|Price]] : 4

### Blessing

A blessing is a trait of a character that changes the whole game for that specific character. Every blessing has a significant plus and a significant minus. In the story, blessings are granted by gods for some service, or when a character serves one (or more) gods. Depending on how well the character serves the god, the blessing increases in power.

> [!note]
> The word "god" is used in this text. However, it could also refer to magical entities, corporations, mafia gangs, or anything else that is “everywhere” and holds immense power over all characters.

#### Blessing and Gods

Everything a character does is important for their world. Therefore, the gods notice every single action. Did the character catch a thief? Steal something? Kill someone? Save someone? Donate something? Based on what the character did, they accumulate points and receive bonuses accordingly—positive or negative.

Good deeds give positive points, bad deeds give negative points. But this varies for each god. One god might be pleased when, for instance, the character helps a thief, while another god might not like it at all.

However, service (or disservice) can also manifest in a god sending a gift or a punishment. Alternatively, if the character serves a god long enough, they might even be spoken to (e.g., receiving advice on a problem).

> [!example]
> The character helps a farmer round up cattle on the farm. This act would please the god of farming but displease the god of the wild.
> The god of farming might reward the character with a big cheese, while the god of the wild punishes the character by sending wild animals to attack them in the forest.

As for blessings, they vary according to the amount of attention the god pays to the character. The higher the character's level of attention, the more benefits they can utilize or receive, such as new spells, equipment, or blessings from the god.

0. No attention - neither positive nor negative
1. Minor attention - receives a small gift or minor help from the god
2. Greater attention - able to converse with the god
3. Constant attention - receives a weak blessing
4. Honor - receives a stronger blessing
5. Great honor - receives a strong blessing
6. Supreme honor - receives the strongest blessing

Characters can gain the god's attention by chance, through their actions, by praying, or by completing tasks in moral situations. Alternatively, they can do something directly for the god.

With regard to points, they function like training points. The character's talent table lists the god's name alongside a starting value of 0. When the character does something good (for that god), they earn points (e.g., 0.01 for a prayer), and when they do something bad, points are deducted. The amount of points a character earns or loses for their deeds is determined by the narrator, who may use the rule of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] for guidance. To reach one level, a character must accumulate 100 points.

#### List of Blessings

Each character can receive only one blessing. However, they may receive multiple divine favors or disapprovals.

- Divine Favor
	- **Description**    
	    - The character receives minor help, a small item, or advice from the god.        
	    - This blessing is unlimited and can be combined with any other blessing.        
	- **Levels**    
	    - 1: The god won't speak to the character but will occasionally send a small gift, sign, or reduce the difficulty level by 1.        
	    - 2: The god will speak to the character like a boss, giving something for something in return. The character must earn the information, or the god will reduce the difficulty level by 2.        
	    - 3: The god will speak like a merchant, offering something for something, but advice will be free (limited to the god's knowledge, e.g., the god of hunting can only give hunting advice). Or the god will reduce the difficulty level by 3. 
	    - 4: The god will speak like a friend and sometimes give gifts without the character needing to do anything or reduce the difficulty level by 4.        
	    - 5: The god will speak like family and may help the character in times of need (either personally or by sending someone capable). The character can ask the god anything, and the god will find out from other gods if they don't know. Or the god will reduce the difficulty level by 5.
- Divine Disfavor
	- **Description**    
	    - The god will attack the character because they go against the god's plans. The character will face curses and villains.        
	    - Disfavor is unlimited and can be combined with any other blessing or disfavor.        
	- **Levels**    
	    - 1: The god causes minor problems for the character, sometimes increasing the difficulty level by 1 (e.g., if the character angered the god of the forest, the god might scare away animals when the character tries to hunt).        
	    - 2: The god sends a small creature to bother the character or increases the difficulty level by 2.        
	    - 3: The god causes inconveniences, like stealing or destroying something from the character or increasing the difficulty level by 3.        
	    - 4: The god will attack occasionally, hiring assassins or creating monsters, or increasing the difficulty level by 4.        
	    - 5: The god will actively attack, sending various strengthened assassins with the character's death as a priority, or increasing the difficulty level by 5.

### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]
( or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/HP\|HP]] )

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] indicate how much damage a character can take before dying. The number of health points is determined by the narrator.

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health]]**. These can be increased by items such as organic shields, magical amulets, and the like. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] also increase when a character invests points into [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]].

#### Health Consumption

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] serve as a cap. With each damage taken, the character's health points decrease. When health points drop to 0, the character dies (unless the narrator decides otherwise).

A character can get injured in battle – that is, when they lose a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat#Kolá v boji\|combat round]] and the enemy injures them. A character can also get injured if they fail the challenge level in a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Quick Reaction\|quick reaction]] (for example, falling from a great height), or they can get injured from an ongoing condition (such as being poisoned).

Each damage received by the character **does not reduce** the number of dice they can use for their roll. _(This rule is still being tested.)_

- Injury 1 = - 0 dice    
- Injury 2 = - 0 dice    
- Injury 3 = - 0 dice    
- Injury 4 = - 0 dice

>[!note]
>- The narrator can treat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] as a resource - where points are spent when injured.
>- Alternatively, they can be seen as a threshold - where the character accumulates injuries, and when the amount of injury equals the health points, the character dies.
>- Which approach the narrator chooses is up to them, our RPG system doesn't mind either way.

#### Health Protection

Health can be protected during the game by:

- Before the dice roll, using a sacrifice to gain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|advantage]] (so that numbers 3, 4, 5, or 6 count as victories on the dice).    
- After the dice roll, using [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|sacrifice]] to add victories.    
- During combat, health can be protected, besides the mentioned options, by choosing a suitable [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]].    
- Or by using armor to absorb damage.

#### Healing Injuries

When a character is injured, how do they heal?
- Natural regeneration (where the body heals itself),    
- Treatment (where the character heals themselves, or someone else comes to treat the character),    
- With the help of items (when the character drinks a health potion),    
- Or with the help of machines (surgical chamber).

##### Natural Regeneration

Injury heals with rest, where the character sleeps through the night (about 8 hours). The narrator can decide whether the character regenerates 1 health point per night, or less (depending on the story and the difficulty of the game).

Alternatively, the character must roll dice for their skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]” against a **challenge level of 3** for their regeneration. (The narrator can adjust this level, for example, if the character is also poisoned, it can be increased).

In this case, the rolls are as follows:
- 3 dice as a base    
- plus [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]    
- plus [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]    
- plus (dice for regenerative items, such as medicines)    
- ! The number of dice for regeneration is never reduced due to missing [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] !

The number of health points healed is equal to the number of victories rolled over the difficulty level.

The narrator can decide that for their story, it is better if the regeneration is slower. For example, instead of 1 health point, the character regenerates only 0.1. So, if there were 6 victories, it would mean 0.6

##### Regenerative Items

Regenerative items are items that help a character in healing. During rest, only one item can be used.

The attributes of regenerative items are:
- **Usage** - how many times the item can be used -> i.e., for how many rests it can be used. If the item has infinite usage, the cost is increased by 10.    
- **Regeneration** - adds dice to the roll    
- **Simplification** - reduces the challenge level for the regenerative roll.    
- **Healing** – adds whole health points

> [!example]
>* Bandage -> usage 3x (3 dice rolls), adds +1 die to regeneration or healing
>* Injection to stop bleeding -> usage 1 dice roll. Regeneration simplification 2 (i.e., minus 2 CL)
>* Ring of regeneration – heals 0.5 of an injury each night
>* Aura of slow healing - adds +2 dice to the regenerative roll

###### Cost of Regenerative Items

The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|cost]] is calculated the same way as for other items (but to save you the trouble of looking it up):

- **Adds dice to the roll = attribute x 1** (i.e., usage and regeneration)    
- **Adds victories to the roll or reduces CL = attribute x 2** (i.e., simplification)    
- **Restores health points directly = attribute x 4** (i.e., healing)

> [!example]
> * Bandage, which has 3 uses and adds +1 die = cost 4
> * Injection, which reduces CL by 2 = cost 6
> * Ring of regeneration – heals 0.5 of an injury each night – this depends on whether the narrator counts 0.5x4 or 5x4.
> * Aura of slow healing - adds +2 dice to the regenerative roll, with "infinite" usage = cost 12

#### Treating Another Character

An injured character can be treated by someone else. The character who treats someone rolls the dice against CL 3:

- 3 Dice as a base    
- plus Skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]”    
- plus [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] focused on healing, without which the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]], or at a [[great disadvantage\|great disadvantage]] in the case of complex healing or deep wounds that need a specialized doctor.    
- plus dice for regenerative items

>[!warning]
When one character wants to treat another character with their spell, only the spell is rolled, according to the rules of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]].

An injured character can be treated with a skill (and talent) a maximum of once every 24 hours. The injured character can then heal themselves through natural regeneration (even if they were treated by another character). However, not immediately—maybe after 1 hour, or only at night.

As for the evaluation of regeneration, the same rules apply as mentioned above. The number of health points healed is equal to the number of victories rolled over the CL. The narrator can decide that for their story, it is better if the regeneration is slower. For example, instead of 1 health point, the character regenerates only 0.1. So, if there were 6 victories, it would mean 0.6.

#### Health Problem

In the story, things can happen that harm the character or complicate their life by causing a health problem. When this happens, the narrator first decides whether it will be a "life-threatening" or "annoying" problem. Then it is determined whether it is "acute" or "chronic." And then it is determined what is needed for the character to heal.

(Based on what is consumed during the health problem, we divide the problem into:)
- **Life-threatening** health problems give the character injury points. For example, for each round, they receive 1 injury point. The life threat can be significant (where they receive, for example, 2 or 3 injury points), and some injuries can be blocked by armor (for example, fire cannot be blocked by armor, but a strangling snake can be blocked).    
- **Annoying** health problems reduce the number of dice the character can roll. These are complications like blindness, difficulty walking, or difficulty breathing. An annoying health problem itself never reduces [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] (like poison, for example).

(Based on how quickly the health problem needs to be addressed, we divide the problem into:)
- **Acute** problems are those that need to be addressed here and now. For example, the character is _currently_ on fire, and if they do not extinguish it, they will lose [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]].    
- **Chronic** problems will bother the character longer, and their effect does not need to be addressed immediately (and cannot be addressed immediately here and now).

**Healing** or solving the problem depends on the problem itself. Therefore, the narrator must specify what the character must do to get rid of the problem. To mitigate the effects of either life-threatening or annoying problems, the skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]” is rolled against a challenge level set by the narrator. The minimum CL is 3.

The length of healing or solving the problem also depends on the problem. In the case of fire, it is enough if the character jumps into water (i.e., 1 round is enough to solve the problem). In the case that the character is poisoned, the poison's effect must be suppressed several times (for example, when the character suppresses the poison's effect 3 times, the poison disappears from their body). In the case that the character has a severed hand or heavy bleeding, they must save themselves with an item that stops bleeding (for example, using a tourniquet. In this case, the challenge level must be overcome to know if the solution to the problem is successful). The solution to the problem and its duration is determined by the narrator.

> [!example]
> 
> - Severe bleeding
> 	- Life-threatening problem, acute
> 	- The character loses 1 health point per round if the bleeding is not stopped.
> 	- To treat, a tourniquet must be used. Challenge level is 3. The character can roll only once per round.
> 
> - Burning (the character is on fire)
> 	- Life-threatening problem, acute
> 	- The character loses 2 health points per round if not extinguished.
> 	- To treat, water must be used (the character can jump into a river) – the character will be extinguished and will no longer lose health points in the next round.
> 	- If the character has no water, they can drop to the ground and try to extinguish themselves. They must roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] against a challenge level of 3. The character is extinguished only if they pass the challenge level. The character can roll only once per round.
> 
> - Frozen (the character is in a block of ice)
> 	- Life-threatening problem, acute
> 	- The character's health is reduced to 1 unless they thaw.
> 	- A heat source must be used for treatment. In the case of strong heat, the character will thaw in 3 rounds. In the case of weak heat, in 6 rounds.
> 
> - Slow poison (the character is poisoned)
> 	- Annoying problem, chronic.
> 	- The character feels unwell, has difficulty walking, and is dizzy. Their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] are reduced to minus 2.
> 	- Slow poison is part of a ritual and will naturally fade after 3 days.
> 	- The effect of the poison can be suppressed by rolling the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]], which is rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|an assist roll]].

### Points of Speed

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] determine the order in combat and also indicate how many items a character can carry in their inventory. The number of speed points is determined by the narrator. Unless specified otherwise, each character receives **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] of speed** (this applies to all characters, as well as monsters or animals).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] can be increased by items such as potions, magical amulets, exoskeletons, and so on. They are permanently increased when a player allocates a point to the reflex attribute ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]).

The minimum number of speed points is -2, at which point the character loses 2 dice from each roll (at -1, they lose 1 die).

#### Combat Order

More on this topic can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat chapter]]. But for completeness – [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] determine the order in which combat takes place. Combat consists of several phases – declaration of action (what the characters will do), execution of action (rolling dice and what happened), and combat result (who takes damage). [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] influence all combat phases.

During the declaration of action, players (and the narrator) state what their characters will do. Characters with the lowest speed (least [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed points]]) declare their actions first. Faster characters go next, and the fastest characters go last. This allows faster characters to react to what slower characters do. Slower characters cannot change their declared actions during the combat round.

> [!example]
> 
A player's character is fighting a bandit. The player's character has lower speed (fewer speed points) than the bandit. Let's say they are fighting in a tavern, and to gain a better combat position, the player wants to jump on a table. The bandit (with higher speed) decides to kick the table. The player cannot change their action since they already declared it.

In the next combat phase (execution of action), faster characters act first. They perform their planned actions before others. Whether they succeed is determined by rolling dice.

> [!example]
> 
The bandit kicks the table before the player can jump on it. (Dice rolls determine if the bandit succeeds.)

#### Other Uses of Speed Points

- When a character exhausts their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]], they can use 1 speed point to restore 3 inventory points.    
- Speed points can also be sacrificed, where 1 speed point grants the character 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]].

### Points of Energy

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]] talk about how many spells a character can cast. So, how many fire rays, how many healing touches, or how many protective shields.

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] of energy**. These can be increased by items such as crystals, or they can be increased when the character invests in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] attribute. In such cases, the character gains an additional [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]].

#### Energy Consumption

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]] serve as a reservoir. After each spell, its energy points are reduced. When the energy points drop to 0, the character will use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] instead of energy points. The cost of spells, for both types of points, is determined by category (see below).

##### Small Useful Spells

**These are**: Lighting a candle, lighting a campfire, cooling beer, healing very small wounds (like a knife cut).

**Consumption**: These spells consume no energy.

##### Common Useful Spells

**These are**: All [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spells except small and large ones.

**Consumption**: 1 spell consumes 1 energy point.

##### Large Useful Spells

**These are**:
- Large spells that act at a distance of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance\|Further 10m - 100m]] and beyond.    
    - (For example, a healing spell that heals characters within a 300m radius)        
- Or any spell the narrator deems too powerful.    
    - (For example, a spell that restores all health points of a character, or one that creates an elemental golem)     

**Consumption**: 1 spell consumes 2 energy points, or even 3, as determined by the narrator.

##### Combat Spells or Shield or Armor

**These are**: All combat spells, or spells that function as a magical shield, or spells that add armor, or any other combat advantage.

**Spell Consumption by Weapon Type**:
- 1 small weapon type spell consumes 1 energy point    
- 1 medium weapon type spell consumes 2 energy points    
- 1 large weapon type spell consumes 3 energy points    

**Armor Consumption**:
- 1 light armor consumes 1 energy point    
- 1 medium armor consumes 2 energy points    
- 1 heavy weapon consumes 3 energy points

>[!note]
Note When the type of combat spell cannot be determined, the spell consumes 2 energy points.

### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]] do not exist by themselves; it's just a name for the game mechanic where a character sacrifices their item, health, money, or anything they own to gain wins for their roll.

> [!example]
>
>Characters are being chased by a dragon. They ended up in a dead end. However, there is a locked door. One of the characters has a big hammer (as a weapon) and could smash the door.
>
>Let's say they have 7 dice to roll and need to beat a difficulty level of 4 because the door is sturdy.
>
>Let's say the character managed to roll 3 wins, which is not enough. Therefore, they decide to sacrifice some of the weapon's attributes, gaining the one win they need. Thanks to that, they break the door.

A sacrifice can only be used for logically applicable things, and each use must be approved by the narrator. Sacrifice can only be used by [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Main Hero\|main characters]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Main Enemy\|main enemies]].

#### Earning Sacrifice Points

A character earns [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]] by sacrificing some attribute either from their body (e.g., health) or from their item (e.g., attack). These points are then converted into wins that they can use in their roll.

- **Sacrificing an Attribute That Adds Dice to the Roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]])**    
    - Attributes that can be sacrificed:        
        - Attributes from an item that add dice to skills, talents, and specializations (not dice for attack)            
    - Attributes that cannot be sacrificed:        
        - Skills, talents, and specializations from the character            
    - The character receives:        
        - 1 win for 1 point of the sacrificed attribute            
- **Sacrificing an Attribute Used in Combat**    
    - Attributes that can be sacrificed:        
        - An attribute from an item that adds dice to attack, increases [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Weapon Attributes\|max damage]], or adds armor         
    - Attributes that cannot be sacrificed:        
        - Combat talents and specializations from the character            
    - The character receives:        
        - 2 wins for 1 point of the sacrificed attribute            
- **Sacrificing an Attribute That Improves Passive Characteristics or Other Points**    
    - Attributes that can be sacrificed:        
        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]            
    - Attributes that cannot be sacrificed:        
        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Weight of Inventory\|Weight of Inventory]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]]            
    - The character receives:        
        - 4 wins for 1 point of the sacrificed attribute

##### Note on Health Sacrifice

When sacrificing health, the character may receive additional conditions, such as a broken arm or bleeding. However, this depends on the narrator. Injuries caused by health sacrifice require double the healing points for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health\|recovery]].

##### Note on Item Sacrifice

When an entire item is sacrificed, or when an item has exhausted all attributes that could be sacrificed, the item can no longer be repaired. If the item is only damaged because the character used some of its points, it can be repaired, but only by a specialist (e.g., a blacksmith repairs a sword). The final repair cost is increased by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Negotiating Prices with a Merchant\|merchant's surcharge]], where the narrator rolls three dice and the resulting value is added to the repair cost. Alternatively, the repair may require a rare component that the character must find.

##### Note on Wealth Sacrifice

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] can only be sacrificed when social skills are rolled. For every 10 wealth points, the character gains 1 win in their roll. The same applies to combat (where wealth points can be used to persuade the enemy to stop fighting), but in this case, the number of points to be sacrificed is determined by the narrator.

Alternatively, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] can be sacrificed by purchasing a service (e.g., hiring a locksmith to open a chest), or by hiring a companion to help solve a problem, or by purchasing a blacksmith's services to repair armor, or finally, to replenish points that the character has used (e.g., renting a room at an inn to sleep and replenish [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]).

##### Note on Sacrificing the Entire Character

If there is no other option and the dice roll is too important for the survival of the entire group, a player can decide to sacrifice their entire character. This will win the dice roll, solving the problem completely and entirely. However, the character will be permanently out of the game and cannot be revived in any way.

> [!example]
> 
> Let's say the players are being chased by a dragon. They ended up in a dead end with wooden doors. One of the players has a big hammer as a weapon and there is a possibility they could smash the doors.
> 
> Let's say they have 7 dice to roll against a difficulty level of 4 (sturdy doors). They fail to roll any wins. Let's say their character is injured and decides to sacrifice themselves.
> 
> Narratively, the narrator can describe that the character smashed into the doors, causing them to open. However, the wall weakened and the ceiling started to collapse. The other players escaped while the injured character stayed behind to stop the dragon. Both the character and the dragon were buried under the rubble, and after this sacrifice, the dragon will no longer pose a threat to the players.

#### Restoration of Sacrificed Attribute Points

Sacrificed attribute points of the character are considered an injury and are restored in the same way as an injury (see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Note on Health Sacrifice\|health sacrifice]]). However, twice the healing points are needed for recovery.

#### Use of Sacrifice Points

Sacrifice points can only be used to gain a win in the character's roll. The cost of sacrifice depends on whether the character wants to match their wins to the difficulty level, or exceed it (i.e., achieve more wins than the CL). If the character wants to match the wins to the CL, 1 win point requires 1 sacrifice point, while in the second case (exceeding the CL), 1 win point requires 2 sacrifice points.

> [!example]  Example (matching wins)
> - The character rolled 3 wins.
> - The difficulty level is 5, so they need 2 more wins.
> - If they only want to match the 2 wins, they "pay" 2 sacrifice points.

>[!example] Example (exceeding the CL)
>- The character rolled 5 wins.
>- The difficulty level is 5, but the character wants 1 additional win, for example, to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Negotiating Prices with a Merchant\|persuade a merchant]] to give them a discount.
>- In that case, they "pay" 2 sacrifice points for 1 win.

### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] refer to the amount of money a character carries. The number is determined by the narrator, and unless stated otherwise, every character receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6]]0 wealth points at the beginning of the game. These points can be increased when the character invests in the attribute [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] and can further be increased by selling, stealing, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward\|completing tasks]].

#### How much money should the character receive?

At the beginning of the story, each character receives a certain amount of money. Below is a list of wealth levels. The narrator determines the character's wealth level according to this list.

- Homeless: (0 - 10)
- Low-income: (11 - 20)
- Average income: (21 - 40)
- Good income: (41 - 80)
- Upper class: (81 - 160)
- High class: (161 - 320)
- Wealthier: (321 - 640)
- Rich: (641 - 1,280)
- Very rich: (1,281 - 2,560)
- Extra rich: (2,561 - 5,120)

If the narrator can't decide how much money a character should receive, they can roll dice, for example, when characters meet a wandering merchant. The number rolled on the dice is multiplied by 10 to determine how much money the other character (such as the wandering merchant) has. If it’s a very wealthy character, the narrator can roll multiple dice.

#### Consumption of wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] (p.w.) in our system are considered as money, such as euros, coins, credits. This is because they are spent in the same way as those mentioned euros, coins, credits. So if something costs, for example, 10 p.w. and the character has 30 p.w. in their pockets, after purchasing the item, the character will have only 20 p.w. left.

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

##### For Example

> [!example]
>- Leather armor, which adds 3 points of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor\|armor]] -> price 6
>- Long axe, which increases max damage by 2 -> price 4
>-  Bandage, which adds 3 dice to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Liečenie zranenia\|natural regeneration]] -> price 3
>- Healing potion, which immediately adds 2 health points -> price 8

##### Quality and Price

If the narrator wants, they can adjust the final price according to the quality or rarity. If the item is rare or of higher quality, the price increases. And if the item is damaged, or is something abundant (like sand in the desert), the price decreases.

- Trash - 16 p.w.
- Horrible / Damaged - 8 p.w.
- Bad / Very abundant item - 4 p.w.
- Worse / Abundant item - 2 p.w.
- Normal + 0 p.w. (base for all items)
- Better / Unusual + 2 p.w.
- Quality / Exceptional + 4 p.w.
- Good / Rare + 8 p.w.
- Very rare + 16 p.w.

##### Merchant Markup

The final price can also be increased by the merchant's markup. To determine it, one, two, or three dice are used (depending on how much the merchant wants to earn). The narrator rolls the dice and the value rolled:

- is added up and added to the final price of the item (when the character buys from the merchant),
- or subtracted from the final price (when the character sells something to the merchant).

#### Price in the Story

When a character wants to buy a room in a hotel, sell a car, or buy a beer—how much will they pay? The narrator can decide how to proceed.

##### First Option

The first option is that the price of an item or service is determined by the number of points (dice, or attributes) a character receives. For example, when a character rents a room in a hotel, they do so to rest and thus restore their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. The price will reflect the number of points the character restores. If it is an item that brings some benefit to the character (for example, a nice shirt adds dice to the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] skill), the number of points (or dice) the item brings to the character determines the final price.

##### Second Option

The second option is that the price is determined according to the scale:

- Cheap: 1 - 5
- Common: 5 - 9
- Pricier: 10 - 14
- Expensive: 15 - 19
- and so on

##### Third Option

The third option is that the narrator looks up the price of an item in our real world, divides it by 30, and rounds up. The minimum price of an item is always 1 p.w.

>[!example]
>A new car costs 22,000 €, so the price should be around 733 p.w.

Of course, the same applies as above. If an item or service is rare (or common) in the given world, the narrator can adjust the price of the service (see section [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Quality and Price\|Quality and Price]]).

#### Earning points of Wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] increase when a character sells something, completes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Body za splnenie príbehovej úlohy\|a task]], receives a reward for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Prvá možnosť Body podľa úrovne nepriateľov\|defeating an enemy]], or performs a job. They receive their money directly from other characters. The money is added just like during consumption. So if a character has 20 p.w. and sells an item for 30, they will have 50 p.w.

#### Negotiating Prices with a Merchant

The price of an item in a shop can be lowered or increased in favor of the character. To do this, any [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used, rolled as an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active conflict]] against any of the merchant's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute. The price with the merchant can also be changed through simple conversation, or the character can solve the merchant's problem.

If a character decides they want to negotiate the price with the merchant, they choose the skill they will use (any from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used) and state how much they want to adjust the price in their favor (e.g., lower the price when buying, or increase the price when selling). For each point the character changes their price, the merchant gets that many wins added to their roll. This number is divided by 2.

> [!example] 
> For example, a character wants to change the price (in their favor) by 
> 
> 1 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 2 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 3 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 4 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 5 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 6 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 
> and so on

> [!example]
> - A character wants to buy an axe that costs 6.
> - The character wants to lower the price by 4 points.
> - The merchant gets 2 wins in their roll.

- When the price negotiation is won by the character, the price is adjusted by the amount they wanted.
- When the price negotiation is won by the merchant, the price is adjusted unfavorably for the character by the number of additional wins the merchant rolled. These wins are then multiplied by 5.

> [!example] (...continuing from the previous example)
> - The character rolled 4 wins
> - The merchant rolled 3 wins + 2 that they received
> - The merchant, therefore, rolled 1 more win than the character
> <br>
> - If the character wanted to buy the item, its price increases by 5 points
> - If the character wanted to sell the item, its price decreases by 5 points

Price negotiation can only be rolled once.

### Points of Reward

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] do not exist by themselves; it's a game mechanic through which a character receives a reward for defeating a group of enemies, completing a task, or for a player playing their character very well (like a good actor). These points are used to increase [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]], increase [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]], restore other points that the character previously used up (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]], etc.), or to obtain an item.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] are always given by the narrator and the player should use them as soon as possible.

The reward points rule applies only to characters controlled by players. Other characters controlled by the narrator do not receive any rewards.

#### Points for Combat

A character earns [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] when they defeat or kill an enemy or a group of enemies. Additionally, they can earn extra points for defeating special characters or completing special tasks.

>[!note]
>Defeating an enemy also means: knocking them out, forcing them to flee, or making them stop fighting. It doesn't have to be just killing.

Regarding defeating an enemy, the narrator has four options for setting the reward for characters. This can be either by the level of the enemy, the type of enemy character, the size of the group (of enemies), or the strength of the group (of enemies).

##### First Option: Points Based on Enemy Level

The narrator can use a luck die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter#Množstvo atribútov pre nepriateľa\|determine the strength of the enemies]] that attacked the characters. This strength of the enemies also determines the amount of reward when the characters defeat them.

All characters receive this reward after the battle and in the same amount (the reward is not divided).

- Level 1 = +2 reward points (number 6 on the luck die)    
- Level 2 = +4 reward points (number 5 on the luck die)    
- Level 3 = +6 reward points (number 4 on the luck die)    
- Level 4 = +8 reward points (number 3 on the luck die)    
- Level 5 = +10 reward points (number 2 on the luck die)    
- Level 6 = +12 reward points (number 1 on the luck die)

##### Second Option: Points Based on Enemy Type

Characters receive this reward as soon as they defeat (or kill) the enemy. However, if they wish, they can receive it at the end of the battle. The fate of the reward is decided by the narrator. The narrator can decide that the reward goes only to the character who killed the enemy, or that the reward is shared equally among all characters.

- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Extras\|Extras]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Unimportant Character\|Minor Character]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Supporting Character\|Supporting Character]] = +4 reward points for defeating or killing.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Important Character\|Important Enemy]] = +10 reward points for defeating, +20 reward points for killing.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Main Hero\|Main Enemy]] = +30 reward points for defeating, +60 reward points for killing.    
- Enemy [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Divine Character\|Divine Characters]] = +120 reward points for defeating.

##### Third Option: Points Based on Group Size

All characters receive this reward after the battle and in the same amount (the reward is not divided).

- One or two enemies: +4 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Small group of enemies: +8 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Large group of enemies: +16 reward points for defeating or killing

##### Fourth Option: Points Based on Enemy Group Strength

All characters receive this reward after the battle and in the same amount (the reward is not divided).

- Weak enemy: +4 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Average enemy: +8 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Strong enemy: +16 reward points for defeating or killing

##### Special Task

During combat, a character can receive a special task that they may or may not complete. For example, an enemy attacks a villager and tries to kidnap them, or an entrance to a building needs to be barricaded. These tasks are optional and not crucial for the “main” battle taking place but can help the villagers. Completing such a task rewards the player with reward points equal to the difficulty level of the task or based on the level of the enemy they had to defeat.

If a character performs a heroic deed during combat or accomplishes something incredible, they can also receive reward points. In this case, the number of points is determined by the difficulty level of the task, but the narrator can increase the total number of points.

##### Group Points Division

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] for combat are given to the entire group in full. This means the points are not divided among the players. For example, if a player is to receive 4 points for combat, each player in the group who participated in the battle also receives 4 points. An exception is the completion of a special task or heroic deed, or (if the narrator decides) the killing of a special enemy. In this case, the points are given to the player(s) who completed the special task during the battle.

#### Points for Completing Story Tasks

Characters can earn 1 full point from the narrator, which they can allocate to any Skill (talent, or specialization). However, the narrator may decide to give the characters another reward for completing a side story task or meeting special conditions of the main story task.

> [!example]
> The players must bring back a spy. Alive or dead. They receive a smaller reward for a dead spy, but it will be easier, while a live spy gives them triple the reward but is much more challenging.

The narrator determines the reward amount for each completed condition in the story task or for each completed side task. The following list can be used:

- Simple task: 3 points    
- Moderately difficult task: 6 points    
- Difficult task: 12 points

The narrator may also decide that characters receive points for completing side (optional or special) tasks based on the difficulty level of the task. If the task involves multiple dice rolls with multiple DLs, the narrator selects only the highest DL (or can decide to sum up all DLs). In that case, the reward would look like this:

- DL 3 = +9 reward points    
- DL 4 = +12 reward points    
- DL 5 = +15 reward points    
- DL 6 = +18 reward points    
- DL 7 = +21 reward points    
- DL 8 = +24 reward points    
- (DL x 3)

##### Main Task

The main task is something that players must accomplish. It is their primary goal. It spans multiple sessions and mainly several story days (it can involve story months or even years).

> [!example] 
>The characters must break into a magical bank. They want to steal a valuable artifact from there. The problem is that it's the most guarded city in the entire country, with many battle-hardened mages, numerous traps, and who knows what else. Moreover, the artifact is in a magical vault that not just anyone can open. The characters don't even know exactly where the artifact is. So, to complete the main task, they must gather all the information, accumulate resources, perhaps hire someone, and devise a foolproof plan.

The main task can be likened to a story from a book. It's something that unfolds throughout the entire novel.

##### Side Task

Alongside the Main Task, side tasks that relate to the main one may arise. A side task should not last more than three RPG sessions or more than a story month. A side task can address part of the Main Task or be something entirely outside the main story.

> [!example] 
> The players need to break into a magical bank with many magical vaults. However, they need a potion from the Alchemist. The Alchemist gives them a task before starting the potion. For example, the players must raid a bandit camp (partly because the Alchemist was attacked and robbed by the bandits, and partly because the camp contains ingredients for the potion). The bandit camp is quite large, so the players must plan the best way in and out.

> [!example] 
> (outside the main storyline)
> The players are awakened at night by ominous sounds. They discover that the village is haunted at night. They decide to (accept the side task from the local mayor and) cleanse the village of spirits.

A side task can be likened to a chapter in a book. It is something addressed over several pages, after which another issue is tackled.

#### Points for Fulfilling a Desire

Every character has something they desire, wants to achieve, or atone for. It can be something small or something very significant that they struggle with throughout their life. For fulfilling this desire, the character receives reward points based on the difficulty level of the given desire.

- DL 3 = +9 reward points    
- DL 4 = +12 reward points    
- DL 5 = +15 reward points    
- DL 6 = +18 reward points    
- DL 7 = +21 reward points    
- DL 8 = +24 reward points    
- (DL x 3)

> [!example]
> A character wants to quit smoking. This is a very difficult task requiring a lot of effort, with a DL of 5. When the character successfully quits smoking, they receive 15 reward points.

#### Points for Good Role-Playing

When a player portrays their character very well, like an actor in a movie, and does everything the character would do, even if it harms the character – the narrator can decide to reward the player. As a reward, they can give 4 reward points (or 8 for exceptional role-playing. Each level is in multiples of 4).

#### Points for Treasure

Characters can also earn [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] when they find treasure, gems, or something truly valuable. The narrator can decide whether the characters receive wealth points or an item. The number of points that the character (or their group) receives is based on the level of the treasure. This number can be multiplied by its size.

- Points based on treasure level:    
    - Level 0 = +2 reward points (Worthless) (number 1 on the luck die)        
    - Level 1 = +4 reward points (Common) (number 2 on the luck die)        
    - Level 2 = +6 reward points (Uncommon) (number 3 on the luck die)       
    - Level 3 = +8 reward points (Exceptional) (number 4 on the luck die)       
    - Level 4 = +10 reward points (Rare) (number 5 on the luck die)        
    - Level 5 = +12 reward points (Very Rare) (number 6 on the luck die)        
- Points based on treasure size:    
    - x 1 (Common size – the treasure fits into a small chest)        
    - x 2 (Uncommon size – the treasure fits into a closet)        
    - x 3 (Exceptional size – the treasure fits into a room)        
    - x 4 (Large treasure – the treasure fits into a house)        
    - x 5 (Very large treasure – the treasure is as extensive as a valley)

#### Use of Reward Points

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] are converted into other character points, which the player records in their table. This conversion must happen as soon as possible. If the player does not use the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]], they will be lost. (Conversion at the end of a combat encounter is sufficient.)

- _For 1 reward point, the character receives_    
    - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Wealth Points]], where the character receives 1 wealth point for 1 reward point.        
    - A useful item based on [[RPG - Item Points\|item points]], where the character receives 1 useful die for 1 reward point.        
- _For 2 reward points, the character receives_ (total points divided by 2)    
    - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]], where the character receives 1 training point for 2 reward points.        
    - A weapon based on [[RPG - Item Points\|item points]], where the character receives 1 attack point for 2 reward points.        
    - Ammunition replenishment, 1 piece for 2 reward points.        
    - Armor based on [[RPG - Item Points\|item points]], where the character receives 1 armor point for 2 reward points.        
- _For 4 reward points, the character receives_ (total points divided by 4)    
    - Restoration of 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]]        
    - Restoration of 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed point]]        
    - Restoration of 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|energy point]]

The player can allocate their points to multiple categories. They do not have to "purchase" from only one category, as long as they have enough reward points. If the player is short on reward points, the narrator decides what happens.

### Points of Items

The character can create any item, provided they have the talent, sufficient materials, and the necessary tools. The character must specify exactly what they want to create. The narrator will then specify the materials needed, the tools required, and whether dice will be rolled once or multiple times, as well as how many story hours the creation of the item will take.

The skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" or "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]" is used to create the item. Other skills can also be used for the creation of the item, but only as an "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|supporting roll]]" (e.g., the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" when forging a sword)

> [!note] Skills and Item Creation
> **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]** is used for creating items that only require knowledge and skilled hands, but not complex machines. Examples include brewing potions, embroidering magical runes into cloth, creating a statue (which a magician later animates), stringing beads (to make a magical necklace), forging a sword, making a bow, and so on.
> 
> **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]** are rolled when the character is creating a machine or using a machine to create an item (e.g., a replicator that makes medicine, a CNC machine that cuts a knife from a piece of steel, an analytical mixer that mixes a potion).
>
> So if, for example, a blacksmith wanted to make a sword and used a machine for it, such as a computer-controlled lathe (or something similarly complex), then " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]" would be rolled because the machine needs to be programmed. If the blacksmith used their hands to make the sword, " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" would be rolled (in this case, " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" could also be rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|supporting roll]]).

#### Challenge Level for Creating an Item

The character specifies what they want to create and what attributes the item should have. Based on this, the difficulty level is calculated according to the following list:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/04-points/rpg-points-of-wealth/#item-price" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.


</div></div>


The difficulty level can be adjusted by the narrator if the character is making a complex item or if they have weak tools or are missing a minor component (e.g., one clip instead of two). Better auxiliary items like a modern blacksmith's forge (instead of a regular forge), a higher-quality hammer, etc., reduce the difficulty level. The amount of reduction is determined by the narrator.

After rolling the dice, all wins are summed. If the number of wins is lower, the item is created with worse attributes or no item is created at all, and the materials are destroyed.

##### Bonus Points for Items

A character can earn additional wins if they use higher quality or rarer materials (e.g., using titanium instead of iron) or if they enhance their basic materials (e.g., creating a purer alloy).

> [!example]
>  - The character is going to make an axe.
>  - They are a blacksmith and have all the materials. Some materials have also been enhanced.
>- They rolled [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] "blacksmith" +[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]]+3
>- Against a difficulty level of 3 and achieved, say, 6 wins.
>- This grants them 3 item points.
>- Enhanced materials provide, say, 4 wins (iron bar 2, better wood 1, better axe handle 1)
>- Thus, the character gains a total of 7 wins.

Regarding rare materials, the narrator determines how many wins they add to the final result.

For enhanced materials, the character must enhance them themselves (e.g., by refining steel) or buy them from a merchant. Enhancing materials (which must be approved by the narrator) is done in the same way as a roll for creating an item. Because it involves creating a better material, the difficulty level may be higher or lower, depending on the circumstances and tools used.

#### Crafting with a Blacksmith

A character can have an item created by a blacksmith (or another specialist). This option works the same as "normal" item creation, with the difference that attributes are paid for with money. In addition to this amount, the blacksmith's fee and the cost of materials that the blacksmith must purchase to create the item are added.

#### Item Enhancement

This involves improving a property or increasing an attribute of an item. A character can enhance an item only if allowed by the narrator and if they have the necessary [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] that can be used for creating or enhancing items, such as a blacksmith or an herbalist.

Enhancing an item is done in the same way as creating a new item. The character specifies what they want to enhance and by how much. To enhance an item, the character needs components. Not raw materials, but actual parts or components that can be replaced or installed in the item. (Necessary components can be created from raw materials.) If the character has everything needed, the tools, or access to a suitable workshop, they can start the enhancement, which can be completed within two hours. It is important to note that item enhancement is irreversible, and the player might even damage their item.

In this case, the skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]" is used. Other skills can be used only as " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|supporting rolls]]" (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]] " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" when forging a sword).

The difficulty level is determined in the same way as for item creation. However, the "strength" of the component (i.e., the number of points it adds to the item) is considered the CL.

> [!example] 
> The character wants to enhance an axe. They have a handle that adds +3 dice to attack. The CL for enhancement will be 6.

As with item creation, the CL for enhancement can be influenced by tools, the workshop, and other circumstances (e.g., if the character is in a hurry).

#### Item Repair

If a character finds a damaged item or damages an item themselves, they have the option to repair it. The narrator determines whether the player can repair the item and what components are needed. It is important to note that items that have been [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Sacrifice\|sacrificed]] or deliberately destroyed cannot be repaired. A character can repair an item only if they have the relevant talent logically associated with repairing that item (such as a blacksmith). It is crucial to remember that once a player decides to repair their item, this action is irreversible. There is a risk that the player may damage the item further.

Item repair is carried out in the same way as creating a new item or enhancing an old one. The CL for repair is calculated the same way as when creating the item (i.e., the number of points and type determine the final CL - see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Challenge Level for Creating an Item\|above]] under "Challenge Level for Creating an Item").

##### What is a Damaged Item?

A damaged item is one whose natural attributes are reduced due to improper use, heavy attack, or unfortunate accident. Despite the reduced attributes, such an item can still be used; however, only its reduced attributes are considered when rolling dice.

If an item's natural attributes are "exhausted," it is considered destroyed and can no longer be used. The weight of a damaged or destroyed item remains the same as for a regular item.

### Points of Inventory

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] talk about how many items a character can carry. This includes holding in hands, wearing, putting on the back, or putting on feet.

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] of inventory**. These can be increased by items such as a backpack, or they can be increased when the character invests in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] attribute or sacrifices 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|point of speed]]. In each case (whether investing in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] or sacrificing a point of speed), the character gains an additional [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] inventory points.

The inventory rule applies only to characters controlled by players. The remaining characters controlled by the narrator have no inventory limitations.

#### Inventory Consumption

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] serve as a limit, indicating how many items a character can carry.

##### Small Items

**These are**: Rings, amulets, herb bundles, vials

**Consumption**: These items do not consume any inventory points.

However, when a character has 10 small items on them, such a "bundle" will consume 1 inventory point.

##### Common Items

**These are**: Any item that is not heavy or large (see below)

**Consumption**: 1 item consumes 1 inventory point.

##### Large or Heavy Items

**These are**:
- A large item is almost as large as the character (approx. 150 cm)    
- A heavy item is almost as heavy as the character (approx. 40 kg)    

**Consumption**: 1 item consumes 2 or 3 inventory points.

##### Weapon or Shield or Armor

**These are**: Weapons, Shields, or Armor that a character has ready for combat. That is - they are not stored in a backpack, but are in hand or somewhere on the body.

**Weapon Consumption**:
- 1-2 small weapons consume 1 inventory point    
- 1 medium weapon consumes 2 inventory points    
- 1 large weapon consumes 3 inventory points    

**Armor Consumption**:
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|light armor]] consumes 1 inventory point    
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|medium armor]] consumes 2 inventory points    
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|heavy weapon]] consumes 3 inventory points    

>[!note] 
>Note When the type of weapon or armor cannot be determined, the item consumes 2 inventory points.

#### Other Rules for Inventory Consumption

There are other ways to calculate inventory consumption. The narrator can decide which method to use, or whether to combine some methods.

##### By Weight

By weight, the inventory is calculated such that for each 1 kg of weight (or 1 meter of length) - 0.2 inventory points are consumed. This method is more suitable for realistic games, or games where survival is key (e.g., zombie apocalypse).

Conversion Table:

| ==Kg== | p.i | ==Kg== | p.i | ==Kg== | p.i | ==Kg== | p.i |
| :----: | :-: | :----: | :-: | :----: | :-: | :----: | :-: |
|   1    | 0.2 |   11   | 2.2 |   21   | 4.2 |   31   | 6.2 |
|   2    | 0.4 |   12   | 2.4 |   22   | 4.4 |   32   | 6.4 |
|   3    | 0.6 |   13   | 2.6 |   23   | 4.6 |   33   | 6.6 |
|   4    | 0.8 |   14   | 2.8 |   24   | 4.8 |   34   | 6.8 |
|   5    |  1  |   15   |  3  |   25   |  5  |   35   |  7  |
|   6    | 1.2 |   16   | 3.2 |   26   | 5.2 |   36   | 7.2 |
|   7    | 1.4 |   17   | 3.4 |   27   | 5.4 |   37   | 7.4 |
|   8    | 1.6 |   18   | 3.6 |   28   | 5.6 |   38   | 7.6 |
|   9    | 1.8 |   19   | 3.8 |   29   | 5.8 |   39   | 7.8 |
|   10   |  2  |   20   |  4  |   30   |  6  |   40   |  8  |
(p.i. = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] )

##### By Item Bundles

Inventory consumption can also be calculated according to certain “bundles” of items, where the impact of the item on inventory is determined by its category. These are:

###### Bundle of Natural Items

**Impact on Inventory**: No impact on inventory

**Description**: This "bundle of items" has no impact on the inventory. These are "things" that have grown on the character, such as cat claws, turtle shells, or tentacles. These species-specific "things" have their advantages, but they must also have disadvantages. (For example, a turtle shell increases natural armor by +3, but reduces [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] by -1)

###### Bundle of Basic Items

**Impact on Inventory**: minus 1 point per bundle

**Description**:

- A bundle of basic items does not include all items in the world, but only those that enable the character to perform an activity.    
- The bundle's name should reflect its contents – e.g., adventurer's bundle, herbalist's bundle, wizard's bundle, traveling doctor's bundle, etc.    
    - An adventurer's bundle might contain a sleeping bag, travel food, a torch, a small axe (for chopping wood), and so on. So, whenever the character needs to, for example, sleep in the forest, they simply "take out" the sleeping bag from the bundle.        
- Each bundle's contents must be approved by the narrator. The narrator should determine which activities the bundle covers. Each world is different, and in each world, "basic" needs are considered differently.
    

**Advantages**:
- Can contain a very large number of items of a certain type.    

**Disadvantages**:
- Items from the bundle do not add any dice to rolls.    
- Items from the bundle can only be used to solve problems.    
- In combat, items can be used only in truly exceptional cases, with the roll result being the deflection of the enemy's attack.    
- The narrator may decide that some items are received only when the character rolls a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|luck die]] (this is described below under the heading [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Luck Roll When Searching for Items\|#Luck Roll When Searching for Items]]).    
- Additional restrictions depend on the game's genre. In some games, the bundle may have an infinite number of uses. In other games, e.g., in a zombie apocalypse, it may be limited to a certain number of uses, and its weight may also be higher.    

**Cost of a Basic Bundle**: (for a zombie apocalypse)
- Cheap bundle with a single item    
    - For example, just 1 bread, 1 water, and 1 bandage.        
    - Cost 1 - 4, weight 1.        
- Common bundle with multiple items    
    - For example, 4x bread, 4x water, and 4x bandage.        
    - Cost 5 - 9, weight 2.        
- Expensive bundle with a large number of items    
    - For example, 10x bread, 10x water, and 10x bandage.        
    - Cost 10 - 14, weight 3.

###### Bundle of Special Items

**Impact on Inventory**: minus 1 point, maximum of 10 items or 10 kg.

**Description**:
- This is a bundle of items that allow the character to perform an activity while also providing dice for rolls or benefits.    
- Items in this bundle are listed individually, item by item – hence it is more of a list of things.    
    - For example, a bundle might include: Belt of Strength, Ring of Healing, Glasses of Perception, and so on.        
- In addition to useful items, the list can include damaging items (e.g., grenades) or items with a single purpose and one-time use (e.g., 1x teleportation scroll).    

**Advantages**:
- Items from this bundle can add dice, benefits, and attributes.    
- Items can be used in combat without limitation.    

**Disadvantages**:
- This bundle uses 1 point even when it is not full. So, even 1 item uses up 1 whole point.    
- The number of items that can fit in the bundle is limited to 10 items or 10 kg. So, if the character has two items, each weighing 5 kg, the bundle is considered full.    
- Exceeding the weight or item limit deducts another point of speed from the character, thereby creating another bundle.

###### Weapon

**Impact on Inventory**: 1 point per 2 attack points. (That is = Weapon attack divided by 2, rounded up)

**Description**:
- When a character has a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]] in hand, it loses 1 point of speed for every 2 attack points.    
- When the weapon is stored in the inventory, it is considered a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Stored Item\|stored item]] and falls under the category of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Bundle of Special Items\|bundle of special items]].

###### Armor

**Impact on Inventory**: 1 point per 2 armor points (That is = Armor divided by 2, rounded up)

**Description**:
- When a character has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor\|armor]] equipped, it loses 1 point of speed for every 2 armor points.
- When the armor is stored in the inventory, it is considered a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Stored Item\|stored item]] and falls under the category of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Bundle of Special Items\|bundle of special items]].

#### Backpack

A character can change the impact of inventory by purchasing a backpack. It adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]]. Alternatively, the character can purchase something like an exoskeleton. In that case, the character gains [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] (which can be exchanged for inventory).

These special items must specify how they change the impact on inventory and by how many points.

In any case, *the change in inventory weight* and *adding speed points* is considered an attribute, priced at 4 points for 1 point.

Backpack or exoskeleton themselves do not have any impact on inventory as items (it's as if they weigh nothing).

##### Stored Item

Only the items that the character has on them (in hand, on foot, or in a place where the item is readily accessible, e.g., bandits with a sword at their belt) are counted towards the character's attributes (such as attack, armor, inventory, etc.).

Items that are stored in a backpack, on a horse, in a treasury, on a ship, etc., are not counted towards the character's attributes.

The character is burdened by the item's weight only when it is on their body or in their backpack. When a character stores an item outside their body, e.g., places it in a bag on a horse, the item no longer burdens the character with its weight. Such an item is called a "stored" item.

This advantage, however, comes with a drawback. If the character wants to use their stored item as quickly as possible, e.g., during combat, they must be near the place where they store their items. Retrieving a stored item takes 2 rounds. If the character wants to use a weapon immediately, they must roll an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] skill check against a difficulty level of 3. If they fail to meet this difficulty level, they cannot use the item in that round. Moreover, the number of rounds it takes for the character to retrieve the stored item to use it is equal to how much they missed the difficulty level by.

##### Dropping the Backpack

A character carrying heavy items or bundles in their inventory may lose speed points and possibly dice in rolls. If the character encounters a dangerous situation and wants to react immediately with full strength, they can drop their heavy backpack.

When the character drops the heavy backpack, all the negative effects are nullified. (The character can only drop the entire backpack – meaning all the items in it.)

To drop a heavy backpack, the character must wait 1-2 rounds (depending on the number of items and the complexity of their binding), or roll an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] skill check against a difficulty level of 3. If they succeed, they can react immediately in that round. The number of rounds it takes to discard the excess load equals how much they missed the difficulty level by. The player cannot roll again to drop the heavy inventory.

Naturally, if the character does not have the heavy backpack on, they cannot use the items in it. The narrator decides on the possibility of using items from a dropped backpack.

#### New or Forgotten Items

When it comes to items that were not considered when creating the character (e.g., whether a climber has pitons and carabiners for securing a rope), or items the player wishes to have (e.g., wants to throw a jug of water at the enemy), or items the player has already used but needs more of (e.g., more ammunition) - the so-called [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] is used to determine if the character has such an item (or rather, if the character has found such an item). If the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] is successful, the character finds the item and can use it. If the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] is unsuccessful, the character does not find the item or finds an item that further complicates the situation.

##### Result of the Luck Roll When Searching for Items

The character is looking for something:

1. Huge Misfortune    
    - Either the character does not find the item.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but using it increases the difficulty level by plus 2 because it is broken.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but to use it, they must solve a problem at difficulty level 3.        
    - Or the character must assemble or activate the item. Assembling or activating it will also have a difficulty level of 3.        
2. Great Misfortune    
    - Either the character does not find the item.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but using it increases the difficulty level by plus 1 because it is somewhat broken.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but to use it, they must solve a problem at difficulty level 2.        
    - Or the character must assemble or activate the item. Assembling or activating it will also have a difficulty level of 2.        
3. Slight Misfortune    
    - The character finds the item, but to use it, they must solve a problem at difficulty level 1.        
    - Or the character must assemble or activate the item. Assembling or activating it will also have a difficulty level of 1.        
4. Slight Fortune    
    - The character finds the item and can use it immediately.        
5. Great Fortune    
    - The character finds the item and can use it immediately. This item reduces the difficulty level by 1 or adds 1 win to the roll.        
6. Huge Fortune    
    - The character finds the item and can use it immediately. This item reduces the difficulty level by 2 or adds 2 wins to the roll.

### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]] are used to permanently improve a character's attributes. Such improvement can only be gained through training (like lifting weights, running around the village, or hitting a target). A character can train any passive Attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]), [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills in general\|Skills]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Talent\|Talents]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|Specializations]], or spells.

The character must state that they want to train and must also specify exactly what they will be training. Training can only be done once every 24 hours, with the training session lasting at least 1 story hour and focusing on only one thing (for example, the character will train the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]"). If the character trains multiple things, their training must alternate day by day.

> [!example] 
> - The character is a chef and wants to learn to cook better. This is achieved by training in soup cooking.
> - In the training roll, they roll the Talent “chef” with the skill “working with hands”
> - (meaning it will be 3 + chef + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] )

> [!important] 
> Basic attributes are not rolled during training. Their substitutes are rolled.
> - For [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] it is “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]”, 
> - For [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] it is “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]”, 
> - For [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] it is “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]” 
> - For [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] it is “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intuition\|Intuition]]”.

#### Training Challenge Level

During training, the character rolls the dice against the difficulty level, which is equal to the level of the Skill (Attribute, Talent, Specialization) the character is training.

>[!example]
> * When a character is training “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]” and this skill is at level 0, or -1, -2, in that case, the CL is 0.
> * When a character is training “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]” and this skill is at level 1, in that case, the CL is 1.
> * When a character is training “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]” and this skill is at level 4, in that case, the CL is 4.

The training challenge level can also change based on circumstances. For example, when a character is learning to swim in a river and the river has a strong current, in that case, the challenge level will be higher. If the character finds a good teacher, such as a martial arts master, or has better conditions for training, then the challenge level is lowered. However, the training challenge level must never be negative.

The training challenge level affects the total number of victories (i.e., training points) the character gains from the training roll. This means that the victories from the roll are reduced by the challenge level.

>[!example]
>- The character rolled 6 victories
>- With a CL of 2, they receive 4 training points
>- With a CL of 4, they receive 2 training points

#### Gaining Training Points

From each training roll, the character gains at least 1 training point (never less).

Additional points are awarded for all victories rolled on the dice that have been reduced by the challenge level. These [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]] are recorded next to the respective Attribute, Skill, Talent, or Specialization as a number expressed in thousandths (for example, 2 victories are recorded as 0.002).

Individual points from different training sessions are then added together with the total number of points. For example, if the character gained 0.003, 0.005, 0.001, 0.004 points during various training sessions, they are added together, resulting in 0.013. Additional training points can also be gained through the system of “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|reward points]]”.

- To gain 1 point in an Attribute, 1000 training points are needed.    
- To gain 1 point in a Skill, Talent, or Specialization, 100 training points are needed.

#### Injury During Training

During training, it can happen that the character gets injured. However, this only threatens in case of a complete failure in the dice roll, meaning when no victories are rolled. The maximum level of injury is always 1, never more. It is important that the character MUST NOT train while injured.

#### Joint Training

The rule for joint training can be used when several friendly characters join together to train. In such a case, the friendly characters perform actions against each other as if they were in an active conflict. They can arm-wrestle each other ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]), try to convince each other with good arguments ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]), or play chess against each other ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]]). Characters can also fight each other (so-called sparring), where the result of the combat roll is not an injury but, for example, knocking the opponent down or disarming them. Players must notify the narrator that they are going to train together, and they must also state what they will be training. The narrator must agree with this (or can change something if necessary).

Characters can train all Skills, Talents, combat Talents, and Specializations in joint training. However, only the same ones or those that have the same function. For example, if one character trains the skill “[Raw Strength],” the other character must train either the same skill or something that works the same way as “[Raw Strength]” (such as the spell “strong wind” from a wizard). Joint training is limited to three rounds. Players can continue training for the sake of the story, but victories for skill, talent, or specialization improvement are counted only from the first three rounds.

The number of training points that characters record in their attributes, skills, etc., are summed up and added to both characters at once - they are not divided between the characters. The challenge level of the training is determined according to the character with the lowest level in the given skill (talent, etc.). Characters take at least 1 victory from each round.

#### Items and Training

During training, characters can use appropriate items or spells to help them (e.g., dumbbells for strength training, a golem for archery training). However, their use must be approved by the narrator. Auxiliary items add extra dice to the roll according to their highest attribute (for example, if a golem has 3 health points, it adds 3 dice. If the golem has 3 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and 4 attack, it only adds 4 dice, not 7).

#### Teacher

To increase their points in Attributes, Skills, Talents, or Specializations, characters can choose to train under the guidance of a teacher (or researcher, scientist, scholar, craftsman, or martial arts master, etc.). The teacher increases the total number of victories the character gains from training by multiplying the number of victories achieved by the teacher's level, reduced by the character's level.

> [!example] 
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 3, the character has agility 0. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 3 (because 3 - 0 = 3).
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 5, the character has agility 2. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 3 (because 5 - 2 = 3).
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 3, the character has agility 2. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 1 (because 3 - 2 = 1).

When the teacher's level and the character's level are the same, the character cannot learn from the teacher. When the character's level is negative, the training multiplier is calculated as if the character's level were 0.

> [!example] 
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 3, the character has agility -2. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 3.
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 3, the character has agility -1. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 3.
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 3, the character has agility 0. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 3.

##### Cost of Learning

The cost of learning is determined by the teacher's level, not by the multiplier. The teacher's level is considered an attribute, so for each level of the teacher, 4 wealth points are paid.

A character can also gain new abilities under the guidance of a teacher - that is, they can learn new Talents or Specializations that they did not know before. Newly acquired abilities are recorded in the table with level 0, along with the victories the character received during training from the teacher (e.g., “fire school 0.052”). The character can use these new abilities even at level 0 because they are still learning. However, until they reach level 1, they will lose 2 dice from the roll in situations requiring a special Talent.

> [!Important] 
> Characters cannot be teachers to each other. The teacher must be someone outside the player group (which means they are not a member of the player group).


#### New Talents and Spells

Characters can learn completely new Talents or specializations, but only from external sources. This means they must find a teacher, discover a secret book, or serve a deity that grants them the talent as a reward. Characters cannot teach each other new talents and spells. They can only train those they already have.

### Other points

The narrator may decide to use points other than those used in our RPG system. These "other" points are used in various situations and denote different states. Therefore, each point has its own rules.

#### Points of Offensive

**Pain**

Pain points are used when an attacker causes pain to their victim instead of injury. The attacker can exchange 1 level of victory for 1 pain point (which the victim receives). When the victim accumulates 10 pain points, they can no longer fight and fall out of the battle because the pain becomes unbearable, and the character faints. The victim can use 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] to "cleanse" themselves of 3 pain points.

**Stress**

Pain does not have to be physical. Therefore, the narrator may decide to use Stress points, which are added when the attacker attacks their victim using [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] skills or when they use the victim's phobia against them. When the victim accumulates 10 Stress points, they can no longer fight and fall out of the battle because the stress becomes unbearable, and the character faints. The victim can use 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] to "cleanse" themselves of 3 stress points.

**Heat (element)**

If the narrator uses elements in their story, they can add Heat points (or Cold points, etc.) to a character. These points are added when the attacker uses a weapon with an element (e.g., fire) against their victim. When the victim accumulates 10 element points, they can no longer fight and fall out of the battle because the effect of the element becomes unbearable, and the character faints. The victim can use 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] to "cleanse" themselves of 3 element points.

#### Points of Defense

**Advantage**

Advantage points are accumulated when the attacker does not use their victory levels during their winning turn and simply stores them. These points can be used later if the attack roll fails or if the attacker wants to completely crush their enemy. The narrator has complete freedom in determining how many advantage points a player can store and for how many rounds.

In terms of the story, the successful attacker dodges the attack during the winning turn. The more they dodge, the dizzier the victim becomes. The attacker later uses this for a devastating blow.

#### Magical Essences

Some spells may require an essence or energy for their activation. For example, ice spells may require an ice essence, while fire spells require a fire essence. The narrator can decide whether the essence is necessary for casting the spell or if it just enhances the spell. Each essence is consumed after use.

#### Points in Story

**Water, Food, Sleep, etc.**

The narrator may decide to track how often characters eat, drink, and sleep in their story. Characters may be assigned 5 points for food (or also for water and rest). These points will be spent based on the number of hours that pass, or the narrator can use them to limit time (for example, a character can roll the dice only 5 times in 1 day because they have 5 rest points. Once the character uses their 5 points/rolls, it becomes night, and the character must sleep).

These points can also be used in a post-apocalyptic survival game. When these points run out, speed points are used, and then [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] (for example, a character has 10 food points. When they drop to 0, the character dies. To earn food points (if they don't have food with them), they must spend 1 speed point to "earn" 2 food points. 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] "earns" 4 food points (or fills all speed points – depending on the narrator's preference). Food points can be spent based on time, with 1 food point consumed every 2 hours, or they can be spent day by day).

Of course, this all depends on the narrator and their game. The food system in a zombie apocalypse will function differently than in a fantasy setting.

### Combat

Combat is a conflict between two characters, where one character attacks the other with a weapon to defeat them. The result of combat is the reduction of the enemy's or character's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health points]], or the infliction of a condition, such as stunning. In combat, all attributes, specializations, and possibly also the skills of both characters are taken into account. So, the outcome of combat is determined by a combination of the characters' physical abilities and their knowledge of combat.

Combat can be fought with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Chrániče na ruky\|hands]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Zbrane na blízko\|melee weapons]] (e.g., swords), [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Zbrane na diaľku a na hádzanie\|ranged weapons]] (e.g., pistols), [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Basics of Magic\|spells]], or combat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuvers]] (e.g., a character runs and knocks the enemy to the ground).

#### Combat Rounds

Combat is divided into rounds. In each round, the players (and the narrator) state what they want their characters to do. Once everyone agrees on a certain action, dice are rolled to determine who wins that round. The dice decide everything, but the narrator provides the final outcome. When the action of every character involved in the combat is completed, the round ends, and the next round begins.

However, actions are not limited to just fighting or moving (or fleeing). A character can do anything that a normal person could accomplish in a few seconds. Overturning a table, throwing a stone at the enemy's head, or drawing a weapon. Simply shouting to another character is not considered an action. For details on what a character can do during combat, refer to the chapter on “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|Combat Maneuvers]]”.

Each combat round is divided into steps: Declaration of Action, Execution of Action, and Result of Action.

##### Step 1 - Declaration of Action

Each character can perform one action in a round, or more, depending on the chosen [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]]. All characters' actions occur simultaneously during combat, even though they are announced sequentially by the narrator or players. However, the declaration of action has its order, which is determined by speed points.

- The character with the fewest speed points speaks first about what they would like to do.    
- Then the character with more points goes next.    
- And then the next character with more points speaks,    
- and so on,    
- until the character with the most speed points announces last what they would like to do.

This order is important because faster characters react to what slower characters do.

>[!example]
> - A knight is fighting against a bandit and has fewer [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed points]] than the bandit.
> - Let's say they are fighting in a tavern, and to make it easier for the knight to attack, he wants to jump onto a table.
> - The bandit (who has more speed points) decides to kick the table to knock the knight off.
> - The knight cannot change his decision because he is slower than the bandit.

For simplicity, it is good for characters to attack each other one-on-one. However, in some combats, this is not possible, and multiple characters may fight simultaneously. The number of opponents a character can defend against is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Podľa veľkosti zbrane\|type of weapon]] and the number of points in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]].

>[!example]
> If a character has a weapon - hand protectors, they can fight against 1 enemy +1 for each point in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]].

##### Step 2 - Execution of Action

Once everyone has stated what they plan to do during the round, dice rolls can proceed. A standard combat roll is performed as follows:

- 3 dice as a base    
- plus dice for each point in all Attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]])    
- plus dice for each point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] for the weapon (if the character has it in hand)    
- plus dice from skills (if using a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]])    
- plus/minus dice for circumstances

>[!example]
> The Black Knight challenges the Green Knight to a duel. The Black Knight's attack is calculated as:
>
>* 3 Dice as a base
>* plus 2 from Attributes ( [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 0 , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] 0 , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] 1 )
>* plus 2 from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] in medium swords (as he is attacking with such a sword)
> * Resulting in 7 dice for the attack.

Combat rolls are also performed in order, but from the fastest character to the slowest. The character with the most speed points executes their action first. Only the dice determine whether they succeed or fail.

> [!example] Continuation of the bandit example
> The bandit will roll the dice first, and the knight second. The narrator decides that the bandit cannot use the weapon bonus or their combat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] for the attack roll because they are attempting to kick the table.
>
>If the bandit fails - the table remains stable, and the knight gains an advantage.
>If the bandit succeeds - they kick the table, causing it to become unstable.
>Then the narrator instructs the knight to roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] against a challenge level depending on the number of victories the bandit achieved.
>
>The knight rolls the dice.
>If the knight succeeds - they stay on the table and gain an advantage.
>If the knight fails - they fall off the table and will be at a disadvantage.

Regarding the combat roll and assistance, combat rolls cannot be assisted, and victories cannot be transferred. Therefore, if one character tries to help another, they can only do so by fighting together, with two characters attacking the enemy instead of one.

##### Step 3 - Result of Action

The winner of the combat round is the character who rolled the most victories. Their number of victories is subtracted from the number of victories of the character who lost the combat roll, and the remainder is converted into what is called a victory level. Based on the achieved level, the winner of the combat round can cause an injury to their opponent, disarm them, or perform other actions (see the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|victory levels]]).

In general, there are two categories of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|victory levels]]: offensive and pacifist.

**Offensive** levels are those that cause injury to the victim (reduction of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health points]]), bodily damage (e.g., severing a hand), or permanent reduction of an attribute or skill (something similar to severing a hand).

Regarding injury, it is important to know what kind of attack the character's weapon has, as the attack's strength determines how much damage the enemy takes. A character can achieve a higher victory level, but if they have a weak weapon, the enemy's damage will be lower. The amount of damage is also influenced by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization#Weapon Specialization\|weapon specialization]].

> [!example]
> The character rolled their attack and achieved 4 victories.
> If the character has a weapon with an attack of 1, they will cause 1 damage to the enemy.
> If the character has a weapon with an attack of 3, they will cause 3 damage to the enemy.

**Pacifist** victory level options do not harm the enemy but only reduce the dice during combat or cause the enemy to be knocked out (KO) – meaning they drop out of the fight.

In case of a **tied combat roll** – where both characters roll the same number of victories, the attack is deflected and no one wins the combat roll.

In the case where one character fights **against multiple enemies** and that one character wins (or loses) – the number of victories from their combat roll is compared to the number of victories of each individual enemy separately. It may happen that they win against one enemy while losing against another.

However, the third step (the result of action) does not have to be the last in the combat round. Characters have other ways to gain additional victories in their combat roll. They can use another maneuver or sacrifice some of their points. More on this topic can be found in the chapters [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|Actions during Combat]].

#### Social Combat

This is a different form of regular combat, where characters do not fight with weapons but with arguments. The result of such combat is convincing the opponent under difficult circumstances - for example, when a detective tries to convict a perpetrator, a lawyer talks to a witness, or a diplomat resolves an international dispute. Social combat can be used in various situations. Compared to normal combat, there are several differences.

- In social combat, skills from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute are used (the number of dice is therefore not counted from all attributes as in regular combat).    
- The order in “social combat” is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute.    
- Arguments, facts, and evidence add dice to the roll.    
    - Evidence is something the character can hold or show - for example, a photo from the crime scene or the victim's diary.        
    - Fact - is a “tool” the character creates. This is done by rolling an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|assist roll]] of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]” against CL 3. The character recalls some information. However, if it is a common fact, the character can also use a book or an encyclopedia excerpt as evidence.        
    - Argument - is a “tool” the character creates. This is done by rolling an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|assist roll]] of an applicable [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] skill against CL 3 (or, if the narrator allows, another skill in combination with a talent - but only logically applicable).        
    - The strength of the fact and argument is determined by the number of victories rolled in the assist roll.        
    - For evidence, a scale can be used - 1 weak, 5 strong.        
- The opponent can use their victory level to “destroy” the evidence, argument, or fact, or to "destroy" the opponent.    
- Instead of health points, "social points" are used in social combat, which function exactly like health points, except that when they run out, the opponent convinces the character (or otherwise forces them to change their opinion).

### Distance

Distance is a combat circumstance that determines when characters can attack each other and with which weapon. Distance is assessed according to a scale that the narrator can adjust to their needs. This scale can be used not only in sword fights but also in battles with spaceships.

#### Categories of Distance

##### Close Combat

- Characters are close to each other like boxers or in MMA.    
- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would stand on the same square, right next to each other.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 0 - 1 m.

##### Normal Distance

- Characters are close enough that their swords touch, but they are further apart than boxers.    
- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would stand on the same square, but each piece would be further apart - on the line that borders the square.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 2 m - 3 m.

##### Within Reach

- Characters are a bit further apart, but if they have a long sword in their hands and extend their arm, they will touch the opponent's long sword.    
- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, each piece would stand on its own (adjacent) square.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 4 m - 5 m.

##### Further

- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would be separated by two empty squares up to 20 squares.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 10 m - 100 m.

##### Even Further

- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would be separated by 40 to 100 squares.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 200 m - 500 m.

##### Far

- In reality, this could be approximately 600 m - 1 km.

#### Starting Position

>[!example]
> All sizes, squares, distances, and scales can be adjusted by the narrator according to their needs. They can decide that one square equals 5 m, or 1 km. Alternatively, when using a map, they can decide that 5 cm equals 5 meters.

The so-called “Normal Distance” is the starting position for every combat. Thus, 99% of combats in all games start at this distance. To move to a more advantageous position, characters must win a combat roll.

If a player wants the combat to start (for them) in an advantageous position, they must attack when the opponent is unaware of the combat. They can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] to approach unnoticed, or they can use, for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] - where the character rushes at the enemy. As for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Zbrane na diaľku a na hádzanie\|ranged weapons]], they can start the combat from their current position.

>[!info] 
>The maximum walking speed is 6 km/h or 2 m/s. If a character walks slower, it can be 1 m/s or even 0.5 m/s.

Distance and movement speed are also influenced by the size of the character. More on this is written in the chapter [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Size of the character\|Character Size]].

### Weapons

Weapons are tools used primarily for attacking or defending against enemies. They can also be used for performing some [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] activities, such as cutting salami, chopping down a tree, or carving a wooden statue. Every [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] use of a weapon must be approved by the narrator.

#### Weapon Attributes

The main attribute of every weapon is attack. Attack increases the limit of maximum damage that the character can inflict on their enemy during combat. Weapons can have an attack at least at level 1 (meaning every weapon, including bare hands, causes at least 1 injury). This level of damage that a weapon can inflict can also be increased with specialization for that weapon.

> [!example]
> The character rolled their attack roll and achieved 4 wins.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 1, they will deal 1 damage to the enemy.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 3, they will deal 3 damage to the enemy.

If the weapon's attack (the limit of maximum damage) is higher than the number of dice the character can use for their attack roll, the character receives bonus dice for their roll. The number of bonus dice is equal to the difference between the weapon's attack and the character's attack.

> [!example]
> The character can use 6 dice for the attack (3 base + 2 from attributes + 1 specialization).
> The character owns a sword with attack 8.
> The sword's attack exceeds the character's attack by 2 (because 8 - 6 = 2).
> The character gets +2 dice for their attack roll.

Regarding the secondary use of the weapon for performing a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] activity, the number of attack points is converted into dice, which increases the number of dice when a skill is rolled. If the secondary use of the weapon leads to damaging the enemy, the attack points are not converted into dice and remain as the level of maximum damage.

The weapon can also have additional attributes or magical abilities. However, for the purpose of calculating the price (wealth points), these will be considered as an attack. As for weight (whether the weight of the weapon increases the attribute or not), the narrator can decide at their discretion.

The attributes of the weapon can help the character not only by adding dice or points to skills and the like but also by improving other properties of the weapon, such as reloading speed. However, these attributes increase the final price of the item while reducing the speed points.

Weapons can also have negative attributes that harm the character or somehow worsen the use of the weapon. Such attributes reduce the overall price of the item. As for speed points, the impact of bad attributes is determined by the narrator, but in most cases, they have no effect.

**List of Some Attributes** (there are certainly many, many more, but I have written these for now):
- All weapons without distinction = Maximum damage, skill dice   

**List of Some Special Properties** (there are certainly many, many more, but I have written these for now):

- **Storing/Exchanging Weapons (all weapons)**    
    - Determines how long it will take for the character to store their weapon in the inventory or how long it will take to exchange one weapon for another.        
    - The normal value is 1 round. Each acceleration increases the price by 2, while each deceleration decreases the price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.        
- **Complexity of Use (mostly ranged weapons)**    
    - Adds or increases the CL that the character must overcome to hit their target.        
    - Below in the text is written the CL that ranged weapons should have. Each increase in CL decreases the price by 3, while each decrease increases the price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.        
- **Magazine Size (only ranged weapons)**    
    - Determines the number of shots after which the character must reload the weapon.        
    - The normal value is 4 shots per reload. Each additional shot increases the final price by 3, while each missing shot decreases the price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.        
- **Reloading Duration (only ranged weapons)**    
    - Determines the number of rounds during which the character will reload the weapon.        
    - The normal value is considered 1 round for reloading. Anything faster or slower increases (or decreases) the final price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

>[!note] 
>Note When the type of weapon or armor cannot be determined, the item consumes 2 inventory points.


</div></div>


#### Basic Division of Weapons

Weapons are divided into those that are "**melee**" – such as swords, axes, hammers, etc. And those that are "**ranged and thrown**" – such as shurikens, pistols, submachine guns, etc. Every weapon must be categorized into one of these categories.

However, what to do in cases where some weapons can be used both for melee and ranged? For example, an axe that a character can throw at an enemy, or a shuriken that can be used as a dagger? This alternative use of the weapon is rolled as a skill (for example, " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] " when the character wants to throw their axe accurately, or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] " if the axe is very heavy. Or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] " when the character wants to use the shuriken as a dagger). In this alternative use, the weapon's attributes are ignored, meaning they add exactly 0 dice. This does not apply if the character has a combat specialization in throwing that weapon. On the other hand, this alternative use of the weapon can cause injury.

And what about shields? Those hand-held ones that can be used together with a sword? All shields are considered blunt medium-sized weapons; therefore, they have all the advantages and disadvantages of medium blunt weapons. A character can use a shield separately, but also together with a medium sword or spear. When a character wants to fight with a sword and shield at the same time, they must have a special talent for it. Without it, they can only attack with one weapon per round.

##### Melee Weapons

Melee weapons include swords, small axes, maces, sticks, hand protectors (or bare hands), and even a wrench. These are all objects that a character can grasp in one or both hands and use to attack an enemy standing nearby (within a range of about 0 to 6 meters, depending on the weapon's size).

The advantage of these weapons is that they do not need to overcome a challenge level for a successful attack. Additionally, they allow for maneuvers to deflect the enemy's attack. Among hand weapons, there are basic types that do not require special talent to use but cause only minimal damage (such as sticks, poles, or tools like a wrench).

The disadvantage of these weapons is the limited range of combat distances. Their maximum distance is "within reach" (4-5 meters), and the minimum is "close combat" (0-1 meter). However, this also depends on the specific type of weapon.

> [!question] 
> What if a melee weapon has a spell that shoots at a distance? In that case, the attack with the spell is considered a ranged weapon attack, as if the character had a pistol.

##### Ranged and Thrown Weapons

These include bows, crossbows, pistols, shurikens, kunai, submachine guns, and all items that can shoot projectiles or be thrown.

Their advantage is that they are not limited by greater distances. Their effective range is from " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Common Distance\|common]] " distance to " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Far\|far]] " (this of course depends on the type of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]]). If these ranged and thrown weapons are outside the range of hand-held weapons, the enemy (who owns a hand-held weapon) can only defend. In their defense, they cannot use their weapon. They can only use skills such as:

- " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] " (to dodge or perform a gymnastics maneuver),    
- or the skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] " (for running or performing an athletic maneuver),    
- or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] " (when they will actively defend with a shield or simply endure the injury).    

The disadvantage of ranged and thrown weapons is that the attacker must overcome a difficulty level that depends on the weapon's complexity, the distance, and whether the target is in cover. If the attacker wins the combat roll but does not overcome the difficulty, they cause no injury to the target (but the victory level remains, and they can choose another option).

Another disadvantage is that these weapons use ammunition. Hand-held thrown weapons such as knives, grenades, etc. have a specific number of uses. This means that the character has written in their inventory how many grenades they have. Once the character uses up these weapons, they lose them and must buy them again. As for firearms like submachine guns, pistols, etc., the exact number of bullets is not counted, but the number of shots after which the weapon must be reloaded. For example, a weapon can fire 6 times and then reload for 1 whole round.

A bow does not need to be reloaded because the character has a quiver of arrows, which takes up an extra inventory slot. Weapons that fire slowly, like crossbows, need to be reloaded. A crossbow can fire once and then must reload for 1 whole round.

###### Challenge Level for Hitting with Ranged and Thrown Weapons

Every ranged weapon is aimed in some way, and there is a difference between small weapons and large weapons. Therefore, every ranged weapon must have a so-called base Challenge level. This is the Challenge level that is later combined with the Challenge level of distance and the target's movement speed (according to the table below).

Base Challenge level:
- Small weapon = CL 1 (small weapons and throwing weapons)    
- Medium weapon = CL 2 (medium weapons and grenades)    
- Large weapon / difficult to handle = CL 3 (large weapons)    
- Very large weapon / very difficult to handle = CL 4 (huge weapons)

###### Challenge Table

| Distance / Target |              |            |     Static without cover      | Static 50% in cover | Static 90% in cover |
| :---------------: | :----------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: |
|       Melee       |    Close     |   0-1 m    | ranged weapons cannot be used |                     |                     |
|       Melee       |    Normal    |   2-3 m    |               0               |          1          |          2          |
|       Melee       |    Reach     |   4-5 m    |               0               |          1          |          2          |
|      Ranged       |    Furter    | 10 - 100 m |               1               |          2          |          3          |
|      Ranged       | Even Further | 200-500 m  |               2               |          3          |          1          |
|      Ranged       |     Far      | 600 - 1 km |               3               |          4          |          5          |
- A walking target is considered a static target.    
- Every speed above 50 km/h adds +1 CL (50 = 1, 100 = 2, 150 = 3, etc.)

##### Type of Attack

Weapons are categorized by their type of attack to determine their effect on the enemy's armor. This classification also influences the narrative or secondary use of weapons.

###### Blunt Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through the force of impact, with the goal of breaking bones, causing concussions, and crushing the enemy. Examples include hammers, maces, nunchaku, various sticks, rods, pipe repair tools, as well as hands or hand protectors.

###### Sharp Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through the sharpness of the blade, with the goal of cutting, slashing, and severing. Examples include axes, knives, swords, and daggers.

###### Piercing Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through speed and thrusting force, with the goal of piercing the target. This category includes all ranged weapons (from bows and crossbows to pistols and submachine guns), as well as weapons designed for stabbing (such as spears, rapiers, etc.)

###### Explosive Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through the expansive force of gas, chemical, or explosive mixtures, with the goal of tearing the target to pieces. Examples include grenades, explosive ammunition, or weapons that generate high pressure or shock waves.

Explosive weapons must specify their area of effect. Whether it is an explosion within a range of "Close 0-1 m" or an explosion within a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance\|range]] of "Normal 2-3 m."

##### Weapon Size

###### Hand Protectors

These are weapons that are worn directly on the hands to serve as protectors. This category also includes bare hands, for example, when a character loses their main weapon or is trained in hand-to-hand combat (such as kung fu).

In terms of size, these weapons can be up to 5 cm. This means that an object protruding from the protector can be up to 5 cm. As for magic, spells that use touch are considered hand protectors (e.g., a spell like "poisonous touch" is considered a weapon "hand protectors").

- In terms of range, these weapons **can** injure the target only in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m),    
- In "normal range" (2-3 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used upon victory,    
- And at other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all, meaning they are not counted in the combat roll.    

As for fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 1 enemy (+1 for each point in specialization).

And regarding any special advantages, besides being able to enter [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Hand-to-Hand Combat\|hand-to-hand combat]], they can do so immediately after disarming the enemy. This means that in the next combat round, they start in the "close combat" position, with combat priority—as if the attacker had the highest [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].

###### Small Weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/small weapons\|small weapons]] for one hand, which can have a maximum length of 15 cm. That's roughly the size of a hand with fingers.

Regarding range:
- Small melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m) or "normal range" (2-3 m).    
- In "within reach" combat (4-5 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used upon victory.    
- In other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    
- Small ranged weapons **can** be used in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m), "normal range" (2-3 m), and "within reach" combat (4-5 m).    
- At "further" distance (10-100 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- At other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 2 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

As for any special advantages, these weapons can enter hand-to-hand combat.

###### Medium-sized Weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/medium-sized weapons\|medium-sized weapons]] for one hand or both hands, which can have a maximum length of 60 cm (roughly the length of an arm with a shoulder).

Regarding range:

- Medium melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m), "normal range" (2-3 m), or "within reach" combat (4-5 m).    
- At a distance of "further 10 - 100 m," only **pacifist** combat options can be used.    
- At other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    
- Medium-sized ranged weapons **cannot** be used in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m) or at a distance of "far (600 - 1 km)."    
- In "normal range" combat (2-3 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- In "within reach" combat (4-5 m) and at "further" distance (10-100 m), they are used **without restrictions**.    

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 3 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

> [!note]
> Even though medium melee weapons can be used at a distance of 0 - 1 m or within reach (4 - 5 m), they do not gain any advantage during combat at this distance.

###### Big weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Big weapons\|Big weapons]] for one or both hands, which can have a maximum length of 200 cm (slightly taller than a human).

Regarding range:

- Large melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "normal range" (2 - 3 m) and "within reach" (4 - 5 m).    
- At a distance of "further" (10 - 100 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used.    
- These weapons **cannot** be used at distances "close combat" (0 - 1 m), "even further" (200 - 500 m), and "far" (600 - 1 km).    
- Large ranged weapons **cannot** be used in "close combat" (0 - 1 m) or "normal range" (2 - 3 m).    
- In "within reach" combat (4 - 5 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- At other distances, they can be used **without restrictions** (i.e., 200 m -- 1 km).

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 4 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

As for any special advantages, these weapons can enter combat at a distance of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|within reach]], where they gain a bonus for “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Combat Within Reach\|within reach combat]]” (described below in the list of weapon modifiers).

(not exist = "armguard" type of firearms do not exist)

#### Ammunition for Weapons

Ammunition can change certain attributes of the weapon, such as attack, but it can also change the way the weapon is used in combat—for example, by adding an element or making the attack effective against invulnerable enemies (e.g., vampires).

The weight of the ammunition is always 1 (for approximately 50 bullets or arrows). Physical statistics do not affect the weight of the ammunition. For larger quantities or larger sizes of ammunition, the narrator decides its weight. In most stories, basic ammunition is not counted (the player can shoot as much as they want). However, if the narrator wishes, special ammunition can be limited by number (e.g., to 50 attacks). The type and special properties of the ammunition serve only as a modifier for the weapon's combat attack.

- **Normal Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that are considered standard in the given story. Basic bullets and arrows that do not change the weapon's attributes (price 2/box)        
- **Enhanced Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that are considered very good in the given story. They increase the natural attack. They may also have special properties like bullets that penetrate armor or can pierce dragon skin (price 4/box)        
- **Special Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that do something extra or change the way the weapon is used. For example, explosive arrows, airsoft bullets with acid, incendiary bullets, freezing bullets (or anything from the Borderlands universe).        
    - The properties of the ammunition, as well as the size of the effect, are determined by the narrator. The effect should influence at least 0 - 1 m. The duration of the effect is also determined by the narrator. It should last at least 1 round.        
    - (price 8/box)        
- **Magical Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that perform some spell upon firing. They need to be activated before firing, consuming the character's energy. For example, fireball arrows or bullets that turn into clay hands and stick the target to the ground or wall.        
    - (arrows attack +2, special effect max +5 = number of victories / direct damage effect when the player wins the combat roll. The narrator can change the ammunition's attributes.)        
    - The properties of the ammunition, as well as the size of the effect, are determined by the narrator. The effect should influence at least 0 - 1 m. The duration of the effect is also determined by the narrator. It should last at least 1 round.        
    - (price 16/box)

#### Weapon Modifiers / Circumstances

##### Unarmed Combat

When the character has no weapon, hand protectors, and no talent in unarmed combat (e.g., karate), they lose 2 dice from their combat roll.

##### Combat Without Weapon Talent

When the character has a weapon they have no talent or specialization for, they roll the combat roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the character is disarmed, only the "unarmed combat" modifier applies (meaning they lose only 2 dice even when disarmed).

##### Close combat

When the character fights at a distance of “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Close Combat\|Close Combat 0-1 m]]” and has the correct type of weapons (e.g., hand protectors or small melee weapons or small ranged weapons), the enemy's armor is completely ignored (as if the enemy had 0 armor).

Regarding hand protectors, they can immediately engage in close combat after disarming the enemy without needing another roll.

##### Combat Within Reach

When the character fights at a distance of “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|Within Reach 4-5 m]]” and has the correct type of weapons (e.g., large melee weapons or ranged or thrown weapons), half of their weapon's attack is reserved as victories (rounded down).

For example, if the character has a large axe with an attack of 4, 2 victories are reserved.

##### Weapon Cannot Be Used

When the character:
- attacks with a weapon at a distance where the weapon cannot be used,    
- or the weapon is broken (e.g., a submachine gun is jammed),    
- or circumstances do not allow the weapon to be used (e.g., a large weapon in a small tunnel), then the weapon is not counted in the combat roll.    

The narrator decides whether the character:
- will fight unarmed (see weapon modifier "unarmed combat"),    
- will fight with the weapon, but the weapon's attributes will not be counted (i.e., the weapon, talent, and specialization will contribute 0),    
- or will be able to use the weapon with attributes (like attack, talent, specialization), but the character will only be able to use deflecting attacks or pacifist victory options of a certain kind upon winning the roll.

##### Uneven Equipment

The character's and the enemy's equipment are at different technological levels. Suppose the character has medieval equipment (sword, cloth armor) and the enemy has modern equipment (bulletproof vest, submachine gun).

In such a case, the character with modern equipment will roll the dice with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|great advantage]].

### Armor

Armor is a passive protection that shields a character from damage in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]] or during a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|quick solution to the situation]]. The number of armor points is determined by the narrator. Unless otherwise specified, every character receives **0 armor points**.

Armor can be increased with items like helmets, gloves, or bulletproof vests. Armor can also be permanently increased by a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk\|natural trait]] the character is born with (e.g., a turtle's shell).

There is no maximum armor level, but it can only be reduced to zero. Armor does not go into negative numbers.

#### How Armor Works

Unless otherwise specified, armor is a passive protection that shields [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] by reducing the damage a character would receive from an attacker.

>[!example]
>- The enemy rolls 6 victories in their combat roll
>- The character rolls 2 victories in their combat roll.
> <br>
>- The character's health points should decrease by 4 points.
>- However, the character has 3 armor points.
>- Therefore, their health points decrease by only 1.

Although armor reduces damage, it does not reduce the victory level. So if a character wins the combat roll but does not cause any injury to the enemy, they can use other options listed in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|chapter on victory levels]].

#### Armor Strength

Each piece of protective gear adds armor points directly. All armor points (even from multiple items) are then totaled together. So if a character is wearing, for example, a helmet +1, body armor +3, and boots +2, their armor score would be 6. Armor is calculated separately only when an enemy or character decides to attack a specific part of the body (e.g., attacking the hands).

The armor level of a given item is not judged by the period or genre in which the story takes place. Whether it's medieval, sci-fi, or magical - an armor level of 1 represents weak or small armor, and a level of 5 represents large or high-quality armor.

1. Weak or small armor    
2. Below-average armor or medium armor    
3. Average armor or standard size    
4. Above-average armor or larger    
5. High-quality armor or largest

#### Armor Specialization

All information on specialization can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization#Specialization and Armor\|relevant chapter]]. But in short: the number of points a character invests in specialization for a certain type of armor (e.g., samurai armor) increases their armor points for that specific armor when equipped.

Armor specialization must be tied to a job, type of martial arts, or specific magic. A character cannot have a general light armor specialization for all kinds of light armor but must specify the type, such as light samurai armor.

#### Types of Armor

However, the rating of armor does not end with a number. Each armor must also have its type specified, which indicates which type of weapon the armor is resistant to and which it is weak against. In our RPG system, we divide armor by resistance (against weapons) into three types:

- **Light Armor**: resistant to one type of weapon. It has a weight of 1, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to multiple skills.    
- **Medium Armor**: resistant to two types of weapons. Its weight is 2, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to one skill.    
- **Heavy Armor**: resistant to three types of weapons. Its weight is 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it cannot add points to skills.    

This resistance can manifest in the game in various ways. Either the light armor gets damaged after each successful enemy attack, or the light armor won't protect the character as well. The narrator can decide which method to use, create their own method, or combine multiple methods.

##### Armor Damage

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain type of weapon. After each successful enemy attack, the armor is slightly damaged, reducing the armor points by 1. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the weak armor takes full damage.    
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain type of weapon. Therefore, it does not get damaged during a successful enemy attack. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the resistant armor takes only half damage.    
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)    

Damaged armor can be repaired by a blacksmith, or if the character has the appropriate talent and tools, they can repair the armor themselves.

##### Armor Effectiveness

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 2 armor points block only 1 damage point.    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is weak against the given weapon). The enemy receives 3 damage points.        
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 1 armor point blocks 2 damage points (i.e., the number of damage points is halved, rounded down).    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is resistant to the given weapon). The enemy receives 0 damage points.        
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)

##### In Our Universe

In our story universe, armor is divided according to the type of weapon attack it faces (see the list):

###### Against Blunt Weapons and Explosives
- This armor is resistant to blunt weapons and explosives. This means that blunt weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Blunt Weapons\|Blunt Weapons]] are: hammers, maces, clubs, and similar. Also includes blunt throwing weapons.)    
- (Explosives fall under [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Explosive Weapons\|Explosive Weapons]]. These include: grenades, explosive arrows, explosive spells, and similar.)

###### Against Sharp Weapons
- This armor is resistant to sharp weapons. This means that sharp weapons do not harm this armor. 
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Sharp Weapons\|Sharp Weapons]] are: axes, swords, katanas, knives, shurikens, and similar. Also includes sharp throwing weapons.)

###### Against Piercing Weapons
- This armor is resistant to piercing weapons. This means that piercing weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- Applies to ranged and stabbing weapons.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Piercing Weapons\|Ranged Weapons]] are: arrows, bullets—everything shot from a weapon (not throwing weapons).    
- (Stabbing weapons: rapiers, spears, and other weapons designed for stabbing.)

###### Mixed Armor
- A character's armor is "mixed" when they wear pieces of various types of armor on their body.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

 ###### Without Armor
- A character is "without armor" when they have no items or clothing on their body that could be considered armor. Or when it is natural armor, like a turtle's shell.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

#### Armor and Elements

In our universe, the rule is that every armor is weak against all elements unless it has magical resistance against a particular element.

Regarding elements in general, our story universe follows the rule that all elements are equal. This means that no element is inherently weak against another element.

However, if the narrator wants certain elements to be stronger or weaker against each other (similar to the game Pokémon), they can follow the chapter on "[[RPG - Pocket Monsters#Elements\|Pocket Monsters]]."

#### Energy Armor

This is protection that uses energy (magic or photons) instead of solid materials (such as iron). Energy armor functions similarly to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]. When a character takes damage, their energy armor points are depleted before their health points. Once the energy armor is depleted, the character is no longer protected.

Such armor can also be recharged. The method depends on the story (sometimes a specific item or battery is needed, or if it's magic, the shield is charged from the character's energy through a spell). The narrator sets the limitations of energy armor and its recharging options. The narrator may decide that the armor can be recharged automatically after combat or, in certain cases (using a spell or item), even during combat.

Energy armor does not affect the character's weight. Some weapons may be more effective against it (meaning some weapons deplete 2 or 3 points instead of 1). Some elements may completely ignore it (e.g., a poisonous cloud that depletes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] directly).

In close combat, energy armor functions normally.

#### Magical Armor Abilities

Magical properties of armor are special abilities that provide additional protection or advantage to a character. To activate these properties, the character must meet certain conditions. Some magical properties are activated by spells, or a combination of talent, skill, or specialization. Other magical properties are activated when certain numbers or ranges of numbers are rolled on the dice.

> [!example]
> * **Thorn Armor** - When a 1 is rolled on the dice, the enemy receives as much damage as the number of dice with a 1.
> * **Ice Armor** - Reduces the speed of nearby characters by 1 point (speed) for as many rounds as the character rolled victories.
> * **Spider Armor** - The character can use the "pull" spell. It combines Dexterity + specialization in Spider Armor. The character chooses a target, and the narrator determines the difficulty level.

These magical properties can only be activated when the character has a specialization for a specific type of armor. So if the character has a specialization in heavy armor and is wearing heavy armor with magical properties, they can use the magical properties. If they had a different armor, they could not. The number of points invested in specialization adds dice to the roll or shifts the activation threshold.

- Specialization 1, 2 = when a 1 is rolled    
- Specialization 3, 4 = when a 1, 2 is rolled    
- Specialization 5, 6 = when a 1, 2, 3 is rolled (3 is the maximum)

> [!example]
> For protective properties, numbers 1, 2, 3 are used. For supportive or offensive properties, numbers 4, 5, 6 are used.

As for the cost, magical properties are considered armor points. So if heavy armor has 3 armor points and magical properties add 2 points, the cost will be the same as if the heavy armor had 5 armor points.

In terms of weight, magical properties do not count towards the weight. However, the narrator can change this and, for example, increase the armor's weight.

### Combat Maneuvers and Actions During Battle

Maneuvers or actions during battle are divided into three categories: "Slow Action," "Fast Action," and "Very Fast Action."

- "**Slow Action**" requires concentration or more than 2 seconds to complete, or it results in a full injury to the enemy (or another full disadvantage).    
- "**Fast Action**" requires less concentration or can be done within 2 seconds, or it has a smaller impact on the enemy's injury (or another disadvantage).    
- "**Very Fast Action**" is something that requires the least concentration and can be done within one second, or it has a minimal impact on the enemy (not resulting in any injury or limitation), or it is an action that must be performed (e.g., a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|activity check]]). The decision to perform a very fast action is made by the narrator.

During battle, a character can perform only one "slow action" or two "fast actions."

A character can (but does not have to) perform one additional "very fast action" during battle (this does not affect the total number of actions a character can perform during battle, as its execution is decided solely by the narrator).


##### More Actions

When a character runs out of actions and needs to do something else, they can sacrifice some of their points to take an additional action.

A character gains 1 fast action by sacrificing:
- (either) 2 dice from the next roll (this reduction lasts until the end of the battle)    
- (or) 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]    
- (or) 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]

A character gains 1 slow action by sacrificing:
- (either) 4 dice from the next roll (this reduction lasts until the end of the battle)    
- (or) 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]    
- (or) 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]

The sacrifice of points can occur before rolling the dice, or as a reaction to a dice roll (either their own or the enemy's).

A character can make only one sacrifice per dice roll. It’s best to use the acquired actions in the same round, although actions can carry over from one round to the next. This means that if a character does not use all their actions (e.g., they have one fast action left), they can use this unused action in the next round (but only in the next one - actions created from sacrifices do not carry over indefinitely).

#### Maneuvers by Impact on the Enemy

Maneuvers are also classified by their impact on the enemy into:
- Offensive (causing damage to the enemy)    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] (where the activity helps the character or allies)    
- Pacifistic (not causing damage to the enemy but disadvantaging them, e.g., stunning)

#### List of Maneuvers

Below is a list of maneuvers. It’s divided into categories for clarity, but the character can choose from any category and any maneuver each round. The character is not restricted in this regard.

##### Movement

Movement allows a character to get into a better position, hide, or dodge an attack. It can also enable the character to use their speed to injure the enemy.

###### Quick Move - vf

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed before rolling dice - very fast action.

**Description:** It is a quick move within 2 meters or within 1 second. For example, when a character passes through a door, hides behind a cupboard (must be close by), or jumps through a window (when standing next to it). It must be a move that does not require any dice roll and has no level of complexity. When the move requires a dice roll or has a level of complexity, "quick move" is replaced with "regular move."

**Repetition:** Quick move can be used only once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. There are no benefits from specialization or talent.

###### Regular Move - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed (or rolled) before rolling dice - fast action.

**Description:** It is a move within a larger area than 2 meters or lasting more than 2 seconds. For example, when a character passes through a door (from a distance), hides behind a cupboard (even if it is further away), or jumps through a window (even if it is further away). It is a movement that requires a skill roll against the level of complexity.

For a “regular move,” you roll:

- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] (for speed or distance),    
- or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] (for handling difficult terrain, e.g., height differences or deep snow),    
- or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] (when jumping over an obstacle).    

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]] is determined by meters - for every additional 2 meters, add 1 CL (starting from 0, so 4m = CL 1, 6m = CL 2, etc.), and the complexity of the obstacle also increases CL (+1 for something easier, +2 for something complex, +3 for something very complex).

**Repetition:** Regular move can be repeated several times in one round, even between two attacks (the character moves, attacks, and moves again). It works as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent for movement, they can use it for this maneuver.

 ###### Shift in Combat Distance - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed before rolling dice - slow action.

**Description:** It is a shift in combat distance by 1, for example, from close combat to regular combat, etc. This move does not require any skill roll.

**Repetition:** The shift in combat distance can be used multiple times in one combat round, but consecutively (e.g., the character shifts by 1+1 positions within [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance\|combat distance]]).

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. There are no benefits from specialization or talent.

###### Stealthy Approach - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed (or rolled) before the main attack - slow action.

**Description:** It involves controlling the character's movement so that no one sees or hears them. The purpose of this movement is to get the character into a better position, or ideally, directly behind the enemy, where they can neutralize them quickly.

For a "secret approach," the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill is rolled against the enemy's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill as a passive conflict (i.e., in the case of a tie, the enemy wins). The enemy may receive more or fewer dice depending on the circumstances (e.g., fog or dry leaves that rustle), or based on the items they have (e.g., night vision).

The narrator decides how many times the character must roll "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]]" to get behind the enemy (or to do what they want to do). This number is determined by meters - for every additional 2 meters, add 1 roll (so 2m = 1 roll, 4m = 2 rolls, 6m = 3 rolls, etc.). The narrator can increase or decrease the CL based on the obstacle or circumstance (+1 for something easier, +2 for something complex, +3 for something very complex).

If the character wins all the rolls in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they reach the enemy from behind and can make an attack against CL0. Each win counts as direct damage to the enemy (or as a level of victory), and the enemy's armor is ignored.

If the character loses, the enemy sees them and can attack. The wins the enemy gained in the last roll carry over to the next attack.

**Repetition:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] is rolled every round. If the character is revealed, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] can no longer be rolled.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent for silent movement, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Charge - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled instead of an attack - slow action.

**Description:** Charge is a combat maneuver based on the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]]." In this maneuver, the character runs towards the enemy and uses their speed and weight to knock them down. There must be a sufficient distance between the character and the enemy. Charge can be used within "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Reach\|Reach]]" distance (4m - 5m).

Each character (regardless of whether they have points in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]]" or not) receives an additional +3 dice for their roll during a charge. If the attacking character wins, they knock the enemy to the ground (see the "[[RPG - Levels of Victory\|Combat Result]]" chapter, option “[[RPG - Levels of Victory#Knockdown (pacif)\|Knockdown]]").

Defense against Charge includes: Resistance, Dodge, or a regular attack if the character has a shield or any loaded firearm.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, the charge can be rolled again as a normal roll. It can be used against another enemy. It can only be used against the same enemy when the character and enemy are within "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Reach\|Reach]]" distance (4m - 5m).

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate specialization that can be used for the charge, they can use it for this maneuver. (Talent cannot be used since Charge is a damaging maneuver).

##### Attack

Attack allows a character to damage the enemy or to disadvantage their enemy.

###### Pre-Attack Check - vf

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - very fast action.

**Description:** This is an activity check that determines if the character can attack when in challenging conditions (e.g., swimming in deep water). The character must first roll the skill related to the conditions (e.g., in deep water, the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill is rolled), with the complexity level determined by the narrator based on the circumstances.

The pre-attack check functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, the pre-attack check can be rolled again. It still functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Analysis of Weakness - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** Weakness detection determines if the character notices something that can be used in battle, a weakness of the enemy (e.g., bad posture, poorly fitted armor, improper weapon handling).

Weakness detection functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] and is rolled as the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once in battle.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. Without them, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Searching for an Item - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** The character finds an item that will help in battle (e.g., a bottle of gasoline, sand, rag). Searching for an item functions as an auxiliary roll and is rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], against the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Challenge Level\|level of complexity]], determined by a luck roll. (So if the character wants to find an item, first roll luck and then roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]).

The level (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|strength]]) of the item is determined by the number of wins the character gets from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill roll (which was reduced by the level of complexity).

The item found can be used in the next round, or if there are still unused actions, it can be used in the same round (see use of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] item). The item must be used as soon as possible and cannot be saved for later. It also cannot be sacrificed.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|Luck Dice]] and CL:
1. Massive Misfortune = CL 5 or CL +3    
2. Great Misfortune = CL 4 or CL +2    
3. Slight Misfortune = CL 3 or CL +1    
4. Slight Luck = CL 2 or CL -1    
5. Great Luck = CL 1 or CL -2    
6. Massive Luck = CL 0 or CL -3

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. In this case, it functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

It is rolled as the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] skill, without the use of talent or items (which can only be used for sacrifice). Armor, shield, or weapon can be used in this roll - the number of points in armor (shield or weapon) is converted into dice, which increases the number of dice in the damage absorption roll.

The roll is made against the enemy's attack. The number of wins the character rolls is the amount by which their damage is reduced. The result of this roll is final, and the damage cannot be reduced further by armor.

Damage absorption serves to absorb the enemy's attack without causing any injury to the enemy. The character does not gain any benefits from a successful counterattack.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per combat round.

###### Spell Charging - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled instead of an attack - slow action

**Description:** This maneuver is used when the CL for the spell is too high or when the wizard wants to strengthen their spell. The wizard focuses on their spell, charging it with full power. During the round, the character rolls their normal dice roll (as if casting the spell) against the CL, which is determined by the length of the charging time. The duration of the character's focus on their spell determines the CL of the spell. If the CL is high, the character can spread it out - but each round must have at least CL 2 (exceptionally 1). Thus, the CL for each charging round of the spell should be 2 (exceptionally 1).

If the character wins the roll (passes the complexity level), the number of wins is recorded. If the roll fails (does not pass the complexity level), nothing happens (0 wins are recorded). In the final charging round, all wins from all rounds are added up into one final total, which will be considered definitive.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, the charging roll can be rolled again in the same round. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** The character must have a talent or specialization. If they have neither, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the spell is quite complex, they roll at a great disadvantage.

##### Morale

Morale affects the enemy's will to fight. Morale is the only attribute that falls under [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]. All maneuvers are performed using skills from this attribute. Another difference is that all maneuvers in the morale category are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]], meaning they do not directly harm the enemy. Additionally, all rolls are considered auxiliary, meaning they either increase the number of dice an ally can roll or decrease the number of dice an enemy can roll. The narrator determines the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Challenge Level\|level of complexity]].

###### Communication Very Fast - vf

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action, no roll needed, used for the sake of the story - very fast action.

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] activity, thrown before an attack - quick action.

**Description:** The character starts shouting or cursing, or rapidly moving their hands—just to intimidate, unsettle, or anger the enemy in some way.

The skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intimidation\|Intimidation]] " is used. It serves as a supporting roll for all other maneuvers of every type.

**Repetition:** It can be used only once in combat.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has a suitable talent, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Negotiation - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] activity, thrown before an attack - slow action.

**Description:** The character will try to persuade the enemy or negotiate with them (e.g., attempt to bribe them with money to stop fighting). This is sincere persuasion, meaning the character is serious. If it involves [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]], where the character intends to deceive the enemy, then the skill Deception should be used (see below).

The skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] " is used. It serves as a supporting roll for all other maneuvers (of every type). It may end the combat with the enemy.

**Repetition:** It can be used only once in combat.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has a suitable talent, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Deception - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] activity, thrown before an attack - slow action.

**Description:** The character wants to deceive the enemy. They might offer something to make the enemy stop fighting, provide false information, or pretend to be weak and pose no threat.

The skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] " is used. It serves as a supporting roll for all other maneuvers (of every type). It may end the combat with the enemy.

**Repetition:** It can be used only once in combat.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has a suitable talent, they can use it for this maneuver.

##### Other Maneuvers

If the character cannot find a suitable maneuver, they can create their own. However, it must be approved by the narrator. The narrator also determines whether it is a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|attack]] roll, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] roll. This is important for more complex maneuvers, which may require talent (mainly for supporting or useful rolls) or specialization (mainly for attack rolls, sometimes for supporting ones).

Similarly, the narrator decides whether the maneuver will be thrown instead of an attack roll, or used before the attack, or after the enemy's attack. They can also determine whether the character can use their weapon during the maneuver.

Most of these maneuvers can only be used once per round.

###### Quick Use of an Item - f

**Type:** Quick action.

**Description:** The character quickly uses one of their items. Quickly, as in within 1 second (e.g., throws gasoline into the fire, while already holding the canister). This maneuver is performed as a skill (with the narrator deciding which [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]] it will be).

###### Slow Use of an Item - s

**Type:** Slow action.

**Description:** The character uses one of their items. The use of this item takes more than 1 second (e.g., bandaging a hand). This maneuver is performed as a skill (with the narrator deciding which [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]] it will be).

###### Performing a Quick Maneuver - f

**Type:** Quick action.

**Description:** The character performs a quick maneuver, which execution does not exceed 2 seconds.

This maneuver is performed as a skill combined with a talent or specialization. The narrator decides which [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]], talent, or specialization will be used. If the character does not have a suitable talent or specialization (and the situation specifically requires talent or specialization), then the character will roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Performing a Slow Maneuver - s

**Type:** Slow action.

**Description:** The character performs a slower maneuver or one that requires greater concentration.

This maneuver is performed as a skill combined with a talent or specialization. The narrator decides which [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]], talent, or specialization will be used. If the character does not have a suitable talent or specialization (and the situation specifically requires talent or specialization), then the character will roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

### Combat circumstances

In combat, various things can happen that affect its course. Below is a list of combat circumstances and their impacts on the fight.

#### Advantageous position

This circumstance occurs when the character gets into a better position than the enemy. The enemy may fall into water or be trapped in bushes, while the character stands firmly on the ground.

The advantaged character rolls with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|advantage]], or if the advantage is very significant, with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|great advantage]].

#### Surprise

"Surprise" occurs when the character attacks an enemy who is attacking someone else. Or when the enemy is engaged in another activity during which they are "oblivious to the surrounding world".

During surprise, the character gets +2 extra dice on their roll.

(The enemy's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] functions normally.)

#### Dual Wielding

When the character has the talent for dual wielding and attacks with two [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapons]], the attacks from both weapons are combined.

#### Fighting multiple enemies

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|Fighting]] multiple enemies occurs when the character decides to attack several attackers or when several attackers attack the character. In the case of fighting multiple enemies, the combat roll is thrown the same as in any other fight. However, the character's victories are compared against the victories of all participating opponents - each individually as if fighting 1vs1.

The number of enemies the character can fight and injure is limited by the size of their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]].

- Hand protectors / unarmed fighting = 1 attacker    
- Small weapons = 2 attackers    
- Medium weapons = 3 attackers    
- Large weapons = 4 attackers

The number of enemies increases according to how many points the character has in specialization (+1 for each point).

When there are more enemies, if the character [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|wins]], they can only injure a certain number of enemies (for example, 2). The remaining enemies who lost the fight - the character deflects the attack. The narrator decides which enemies this applies to.


</div></div>


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/05-combat/rpg-victory-levels/#victory-levels" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



### Victory levels

The outcome of the action is the final phase of the combat round, in which the winner of that combat round is determined, as well as what happens to the loser of that combat round. The winner of the combat round is the character who rolled the most victories. The number of their victories is subtracted from the number of victories of the character who lost the combat roll, and the remainder is converted into the so-called victory level. The winner can inflict injury on their enemy, disarm them, or do other things—depending on the number of victories achieved.

In the case when the combat roll is tied, meaning both sides rolled the same number of victories, the combat round ends in a draw. In this case, the characters' attacks are simply deflected, or they miss each other.

> [!example]
> - A knight and a bandit are fighting each other.
> - The knight rolls their combat roll and gets 2 victories.
> - The bandit rolls their combat roll and gets 4 victories.
> - The bandit won the combat roll and achieved a victory level of 2.

The attacker who achieved a certain victory level can choose one option from the list below. When making the selection, they must consider whether they are a pacifist (which requires using a pacifist option) and what weapon they attacked with, as the weapon determines the level of injury ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|see the weapons chapter]]).

#### Reservation of Victories

The character who won the combat round can choose only one option from the available victory levels. If the character achieved more victories than necessary for the chosen option, the remaining victories remain unused. However, these victories are not wasted because the victories that the character did not use in their combat round carry over to the next combat roll. These victories will reduce the total number of dice the character can roll in the next combat roll—thus reserving the victories for the next roll.

> [!info] In-game, it will look like this: :
> The attacker rolled 6 victories and used the option from victory level 4.
> Therefore, they have 2 unused victories left. These victories will carry over to the second round.
> If the attacker has 8 dice for the combat roll, they will lose 2 dice in the next round (as they are automatically converted into victories), and the next combat roll will be thrown with 6 dice.

The reservation must be approved by the narrator, and victories cannot be carried over indefinitely.

#### Victory Levels

The character who won the combat round can choose one of the available options based on the number of victories they achieved. These options are sorted according to the level required to activate them. However, the character can choose a lower level option, even if they achieved more victories.

##### Victory Level 1

###### Change in Combat Distance (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack and quickly moves to a better position. This increase (or decrease) in combat distance between the enemy and the character lasts until another change in distance occurs (e.g., if the enemy wins the combat round and uses this option).

- For every **1 victory level**, the character can change their combat distance by 1.    
- The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the distance the character covers (+1 for each point).    
- If the character has unused points from weapon specialization (e.g., the distance can be changed by 1, but the character has 3 points in specialization), the unused points reserve victories for the next round.

###### Gaining Initiative (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack, slowing them down and gaining an advantage. This initiative gain lasts for 1 round.
- For every **1 victory level**, the character advances 1 level in combat initiative in the next round (as if they suddenly had a higher REF by 1 point).    
- The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the distance the character covers (+1 for each point).     
- If the character has unused points from weapon specialization (e.g., the initiative can be changed by 1, but the character has 3 points in specialization), the unused points reserve victories for the next round.

###### Stagger (pacifist)

Pacifist option. For each 1 victory level, the enemy loses 1 die in the next round. The loss of dice applies only for 1 round.

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the number of dice the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

###### Adding Damaging Points (optional)

When the narrator uses other points than those already in our RPG system, this option becomes available. If not, this option is ignored.

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the number of offensive points the enemy receives (+1 for each point).

For each 1 victory level, the enemy receives 1 offensive point. This could be pain, stress, heat, etc. The rules for offensive points are found in the chapter [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Other points\|Various points]].

> [!example]
> **Pain**
> Pain points are used when the attacker causes pain instead of injury to their victim. The attacker can exchange 1 victory level for 1 pain point (which the victim receives). When the victim accumulates 10 pain points, they can no longer fight and drop out of the combat as the pain becomes unbearable and they pass out. The victim can use 1 health point to "cleanse" 3 pain points.

###### Injury (dmg)

Injury is an offensive option. For each 1 victory level, the enemy receives 1 injury point. The maximum amount of injury is determined by the weapon, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|specialization]] for that weapon, and the enemy's armor.

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the amount of injury the enemy receives (+1 for each point).

> [!example]
> The character rolled their attack roll and achieved 4 victories.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 1, they will deal 1 damage to the enemy.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 3, they will deal 3 damage to the enemy.

##### Victory Level 2

###### Gaining a Quick Action (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack, slowing them down and gaining an advantage.

- For every **2 victory levels**, the character gains +1 quick action in the next round.

###### Damaging Armor  (pacifist)

The character uses their weapon to damage the enemy's armor. For every 2 victory levels, the enemy loses 1 armor point until the end of the battle.

If the enemy has armor that is resistant to the character's weapon, the armor damage is halved (rounded down).

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the amount of armor the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

###### Poškodenie zbrane (pacifist)

The character uses their weapon to damage the enemy's weapon. For every 2 victory levels, the enemy loses 1 point from the weapon's attack attribute until the end of the battle.

The number of points the attacker has invested in their combat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the amount of armor the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

(Attack attributes of the weapon are considered to be all attributes the weapon possesses that help the character. This includes magic, reloading speed, etc. The player must specify which attribute they want to reduce.)

##### Victory Level  3

###### Pain (pacifist)

The character inflicts an unpleasant injury on the enemy, such as scratching or striking them hard. It's nothing serious, but the enemy will feel it until the end of the fight.

- For every **3 victory levels**, the enemy loses 1 die from their attack until the end of the fight.    
- The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the number of dice the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

###### Disarmament (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character uses their speed and skill to disarm the enemy. The enemy will be disarmed until the end of the fight (but at least for 1 whole combat round).

To find their weapon again, the enemy needs to overcome a CL determined by the number of victories from the character's roll. They roll the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]. Finding the weapon is considered a quick action.

###### Knockdown (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character uses their speed or strength to knock down the enemy. The knocked-down enemy cannot move, cannot change combat distances, and can only defend.

To stand up again, the enemy needs to overcome a DL determined by the number of victories from the character's roll. They roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]. The attempt to stand up is considered a quick action.

##### Victory Level 4

###### Gaining a Slow Action (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack, slowing them down and gaining an advantage.

- For every **4 victory levels**, the character gains +1 slow action in the next round.

###### Severing a Limb (dmg)

This is an offensive option. The character severs the enemy's arm or leg (or another limb). The enemy permanently loses 1 whole attribute (refer to the list of disadvantages - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Disabling Characteristic#item 6 - Missing Limb\|missing limb]]). Additionally, the enemy receives a bleeding status, losing 1 health point per round until the bleeding is stopped.

The difficulty of stopping the bleeding is determined by the number of victories from the character's roll.

##### Victory Level 5 and Above

###### K.O. (dmg / pacifist )

When the character's number of victories is higher by 1 than the remaining health points of the enemy (along with the remaining armor points), the character can choose one of these options:

- **K.O. (? dmg/pacif - decided by the narrator)**    
    - The enemy falls into a coma and drops out of the fight. If the character wants to additionally kill the enemy, they must overcome a difficulty level of 1 in their combat roll. The enemy's armor is not counted during this attack.        
- **Surrender (pacif)**    
    - The character forces the enemy to surrender. The enemy drops out of the fight, and the character can also bind them (automatically, without any dice roll).        
- **Death (dmg)**    
    - The character kills the enemy with one brutal strike.

### Basics of Magic

This chapter contains basic information about magic, which you can use to create your own magical system. If you are looking for a magical system directly from our universe, you will find it in another book [[MAG - Full Book\|MAG - Full Book]].

>[!warning] 
>The word '[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]]' or the word 'spell' in our RPG system is used as:
>- A spell (fireball)
>- Super abilities (laser eyes) 
>- Sci-fi technologies (hologram, teleport) 
>- Skills of skilled craftsmen (a cook and his spell 'my special pizza') 
>- Traits according to the type of character (a turtle that can spit out a stream of water) 
>- and other similar things.

A character can use magic for combat, defense, or to perform any other activity that comes from the given spell (e.g., a fireball to light a campfire).

Magic and spells work the same way as: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|skills]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|Combat]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|Weapons]]. So if you have read these chapters, you already know almost everything about magic.

#### Who Can Use Spells?

Unless otherwise specified, any character can use magic. However, the narrator can modify this by setting specific restrictions in their magical system.

>[!example] 
> - Magic can only be used by a character with a certain attribute level (e.g., INT 2 and above),
> - or requires a special talent (e.g., fire school 1),
> - or requires a specialization (e.g., ranged fire spells 2),
> - or must have an item to cast spells (e.g., spell crystal),
> -  or an essence (e.g., fire essence),
> - or a weapon with a spell (e.g., fire axe).

If a character without a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|specialization]] (for combat magic) uses magic, they roll with a major [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the character has a talent but no specialization in combat spells from that school, they roll normally (no major disadvantage), but they do not get any dice from the talent.

>[!example]
>The talent "fire school." For the offensive spell fireball, the character gets no dice but rolls normally. (Without the talent, they would have to roll with a major disadvantage.)

##### Talent and Knowledge of Magic

One way the narrator can restrict the use of magic is by tying magical knowledge to a character's talent. This means that a character will only know spells or magical items that have the same level as the number of points the character has invested in their magical talent. So the number of points in the talent indicates the maximum level of magic the character can use (that they remember). If a character wants to use a higher-level spell, they must find it in a book, but cannot use it from memory.

>[!example]
> - 1 point in talent = Level 1
> - 2 points in talent = Level 2
> - 3 points in talent = Level 3
> - 4 points in talent = Level 4

If the narrator's magic system does not use levels, the number of points in the talent indicates the maximum attack strength (or spell effectiveness) the character can use.

>[!example]
> - 1 point in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 2
> - 2 points in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 4
> - 3 points in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 6
> - 4 points in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 8
> - 5 points similarly = the number of points in the talent is multiplied by 2.

If a spell does not require talent, or the character has a minus in talent, the maximum number of dice (or other points) for the spell becomes 1 or Level 0.

#### Talent and Knowledge of Magic

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is used for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spells, specialization for offensive spells and passive spells (which can be passively [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] or passively offensive). Each point in talent adds a die to the roll when the character is solving a problem with a spell (similarly to skills).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] adds dice to the magical combat roll, increases the maximum damage of the spell, and reduces the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|CL]] for passive spells.

#### Magic Effects

Unless otherwise specified, magic is neutral. Offensive spells can harm allies, and healing spells can heal enemies. This is especially true when they are within the spell's effect range or when the character fails their dice roll.

### Spells

A spell is created when magical talent or magical specialization combines with a skill. Spells can be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]], and they can be cast independently (as active spells) or function automatically (as passive spells) when a condition is met.

#### Active and Passive Spells

**Active spells** are those that the character decides to cast. This can be when a situation arises in the story that the character wants to resolve using a spell (similarly to skills), or during combat when the character attacks someone. Active attack spells can have their unique levels of victory but also have a cost that must be paid (more on this topic is written in the section about [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Cost of Magic\|the cost of magic]]).

**Passive spells** function automatically, but only during certain rolls. For example, only during combat, or when the character is swimming, and so on. Passive spells activate when certain numbers are rolled on the dice. For example, if the number 1 is rolled during combat, the character gets +1 frost armor for each number 1 rolled.

#### How are spells cast?

Each spell is cast as follows:

- 3 dice as the base    
- plus dice from basic Attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]])    
- plus dice from magical talent when casting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spells    
- plus dice from magical specialization when casting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]] spells    
- plus dice from skill    
- plus/minus dice for bonuses from items (if the character has any)    
- plus/minus dice for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances\|circumstances]] (if they are present)

#### How are spells created?

The storyteller can create spells as needed and as it fits into their story. Generally, useful spells are created by combining a magical [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] with a skill. Offensive spells are created by combining a magical [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] with a skill. This means that each spell is connected to a skill. All the spells of a character are then written into the character sheet.

>[!example]
>Ice Shield - specialization Ice Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]
>Fire Wall - specialization Fire Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]
>Wind Arrows - specialization Wind Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]
>Jump - specialization Robo Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] (the character has robotic legs)

Which spell can be connected with which skill? Each skill has a list of verbs associated with it (for example, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]] has verbs like: understand, guess, analyze, solve a puzzle). So you just need to look at the list of verbs for each skill and choose the one that fits.

If you can't choose because your verb (the action the spell is supposed to perform) isn't there, you can create a new skill. This new skill is written into the list of talents (or wherever there is space in the character sheet) and assigned a main attribute. This skill can also be used in the game if the storyteller allows, but its main purpose is to create a spell (for example, teleport, which is not a great example because teleport is created with the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]], because sprint includes a jump).

As for the verbs, each element also has its own list of verbs.

##### Purely Combat Spells

For combat spells, the rule remains that they must be linked to a skill. Additionally, they must be connected to a combat skill from which they can choose a verb (allowed action) they need. However, this "combat skill" does not add any dice and does not require the character to use points to purchase this "combat skill." It mainly serves as a reminder of what the spell actually does.

>[!example]
>Spell "Fireball"
> - specialization Fire School
> - plus skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]
> - plus combat skill (explode, burn – see verbs for combat spells below)

##### Limitations

However, there are a few limitations when creating spells. For instance, one skill can only be associated with one talent or specialization. Unless, of course, it is another function of the same spell, such as creating an ice wall and creating an ice bridge – in this case, multiple spells can be associated with one skill. But otherwise, it is not possible.

If the storyteller (or character) needs to create spells in their character sheet that require the same skill, then they must invest 1 skill point (the point used to invest in skills, talents, and specializations when creating a character) into that spell. For such a spell, the character also gets +1 die for that 1 point.

A spell also cannot be associated with multiple skills. Only one. If a spell needs to have multiple skills, then multiple spells must be created, which are cast sequentially like a "chain." In this case, all spells (before the main one) are cast as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

##### Enhancing a Spell

Each spell can be enhanced by investing a point into that spell during character creation, as well as by using magical items, essence, or training.

- An item enhances a spell when the character holds or wears the item. If the item is removed from the character's body or sold, the item no longer enhances the spell. (e.g., glasses: spell "seeing through walls" +2 dice)    
- Essence enhances a spell when the character uses it during casting. However, the essence burns out after the spell is cast.    
- A spell can be permanently enhanced through training or by the character investing points into it. Such a spell is written into the character sheet along with the number of points. And every time the character casts that spell, the dice from the enhancement points are added.
 
#### Are All Spells Weapons?

We classify spells as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]]. However, all spells, regardless of classification, must have some weapon attributes based on what type of weapon they resemble.

- Whether they resemble a melee weapon (like a sword) or a ranged/thrown weapon.    
- Whether they are similar to a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Blunt weapons\|Blunt]] weapon, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Sharp weapons\|Sharp]] weapon, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Piercing weapons\|Piercing]] weapon, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Explosive weapons\|Explosive]] weapon (for explosive weapons, the area of effect must be determined).    
- The size of this weapon and its area of effect, whether it is a touch weapon (like hand guards), a small weapon, a medium weapon, or a large weapon.    
- Whether this weapon uses ammunition and if any special ammunition can be used. (Everything else about classification is written in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapons chapter]].)

Another attribute that weapons have is attack. Therefore, combat spells also have attacks, which determine the maximum damage a character can deal to their enemy during combat. All spells have an attack level of 1 (meaning each combat spell causes at least 1 injury). This level of damage that a spell can cause can be increased by specialization in a particular school of spells, as well as by items and investment in spells.

#### Victory Levels of Spells

Offensive spells can have their own [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|victory levels]] written next to them. For example, a fireball at Victory Level 1 causes burns, but at Victory Level 3, it sets the enemy on fire. Similarly, a spell at a higher victory level can inflict a status on the enemy (such as making them catch fire). In this case, the victory level also becomes the Level of Difficulty, which the enemy must overcome to rid themselves of the status. Healing the status during combat is considered a quick action.

### Cost of Magic

In our RPG system, every magic and every spell has its cost.

The hidden or indirect cost lies in the character's attributes, as every character wanting to use their magic safely must invest points into their magical talent or specialization. Another, slightly less hidden cost is the complexity level of the given spell. Lastly, magic is directly paid for in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]].

If a character does not "pay" the cost of magic, they cannot cast spells at all, or their casting will have serious consequences in case of failure.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]] are necessary for casting spells, and without them, a character cannot cast. Each character has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]], which can be increased by investing points into the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] attribute. In short, the cost of spells can be summarized as follows: every [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spell costs 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]], and every [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]] spell costs 2 points. (More on this topic can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Energy\|relevant section]].)

Points in talents or specialization, mentioned in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Basics of Magic\|basics of magic]] section, increase the number of dice the character can use in their magical roll. This increases the chances of not failing the roll or saving time needed for casting (because if the complexity level is too high, the character may have to roll multiple times. More details can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers#Spell Charging - f\|combat maneuvers]] section.)

There are several options for the complexity level, each of which the narrator can adjust as they see fit.

#### Spell Challenge Level

The Challenge level is the threshold that a character must overcome in their dice roll. If they do not pass the threshold, the spell is not created, or something worse may happen (see the section on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Spellcasting Failure\|spellcasting failure]]). The Challenge level is not fixed—meaning the narrator can choose from several options. They can set the cost based on the level of magic, what the spell can do, set the Challenge level as the cost of an item, or decide not to set a Challenge level but allow the character to buy advantages in the spell with victories. These options can also be combined—it depends on the narrator.

##### Magic Level (first option)

The magic level (tier) is the threshold that determines whether the character knows the magic. If the character has a magical talent at level 1, they cannot perform magic from level 2 (maybe only if they had a book that increased their level, but otherwise not). This does not affect the Challenge level of solving the problem; it remains the same. The magic level threshold only indicates whether the character can use the spell to solve the problem or not.

>[!example]
>Fire Spell - level 2 = Challenge level 2 (or the character needs a talent in fire spells at level 2).

###### Primitive Magic – Level 0 -

**Rarity:** This magic is literally found everywhere and anyone can perform it, as it is as simple as striking a match or breathing.

**Who Knows It:** Everyone, even children, can do it. No one needs to learn it, or maybe just a little. Thus, a character does not need any talent to use it.

**Who Can Do It:** Everyone

**Where to Buy It:** It can be bought everywhere, commonly in stores, even at a newsstand. It can also be found freely on the street.

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires four times the amount of resources or four times the duration to achieve its effect (e.g., 4g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound for 4 days, 4 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can only perform very simple tasks that characters can do "almost with their eyes closed." For example, tying shoelaces, turning on a light, closing a door.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)
- Can use a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of strength 1. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|point]].    

**For Example:**

- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). It is the same with magic at level 0.    
- Light: Shines like a candle.    
- Cooling: Cools hands to about 20 degrees.

###### Common – Level 1 -

**Rarity:** It is found in everyday life, at home, with neighbors, but not everyone possesses it - for example, homeless people may not have it.

**Who Knows It:** Adults can do it, but children cannot because they need to learn it. It is like collecting and drying herbs - one must learn which herbs are medicinal and which are poisonous.

**Who Can Do It:** Everyone

**Where to Buy It:** It can be bought in any ordinary store.

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires three times the amount of resources or three times the duration to achieve its effect (e.g., 3g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound for 3 days, 3 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can perform such common tasks that characters can do - for example, heating food like a microwave.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of strength 2. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]].

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 1 can heal the wound in 2 days, plus cleanses the wound (like alcohol).    
- Light: Shines like a motorcycle light.    
- Cooling: Cools the entity to about 20 degrees.

###### Uncommon – Level 2 -

**Rarity:** Found in specialized places such as special stores (hardware stores), or in schools or libraries.

**Who Knows It:** Any student who studies this magic or someone who practices it as a hobby (e.g., an amateur electrician) can do it.

**Who Can Do It:** Only ordinary beings, not blessed ones.

**Where to Buy It:** It can be purchased in an unusual store (e.g., a hardware store).

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires double the amount of resources or double the duration to achieve its effect (e.g., 2g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound for 2 days, 2 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can perform tasks that characters usually do but require more effort, or a handyman (e.g., painting an apartment, moving heavy furniture, driving a car).

Unusual magic also includes items like magical crystals or other things we would consider miraculous in our real world and can be bought in those "magic stores" (e.g., healing stones, magical herbs, various amulets).

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of total strength 4. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]]. 

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 2 can do it overnight, plus it can heal the wound if it is inflamed (if the wound is more inflamed, the magic needs to be used multiple times).    
- Light: Shines like a street lamp or the light on a large vehicle.    
- Cooling: Cools a room to 0 degrees.

###### Exceptional – Level 3 -

**Rarity:** Found only in specialized places like a doctor's office or an architect's studio.

**Who Knows It:** A good university student or a specialist who has graduated from university (e.g., a doctor, an architect) can perform it.

**Who Can Do It:** Only beings who have learned this magic. Not blessed ones.

**Where to Buy It:** It can only be purchased in specialized shops (e.g., a 3D printer store) or found in specialized locations (e.g., a medical university library).

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires the usual amount of resources or application (e.g., 1g of a resource - as the recipe requires, applying to a wound only once, 1 liter of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can perform tasks that specialists can do. This magic may break one or two natural laws of the given world.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of total strength 6. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 6 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]].

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 3 can do it in a few minutes (for a large wound or severe inflammation about 1 hour).    
- Light: Shines like a stadium spotlight. The light spell can be specialized to shine only on the objects the wizard wants to illuminate.    
- Cooling: Cools all rooms in an apartment building to 0 degrees. Cools a room to -20 degrees.

###### Rare – Level 4 -

**Rarity:** Found in highly specialized places (e.g., research institutes that are unique in the district). Or in markets, royal treasuries, museums, ruins, or other inaccessible places. It exists in limited quantities and is known only by true experts.

**Who Knows It:** Only a professional who has been doing it for a long time (something like a kung-fu master) can perform it.

**Who Can Do It:** Only beings who have learned this magic. Not blessed ones.

**Where to Buy It:** In markets where rare items are sold, in museums (when the museum sells items to collectors), or from adventurers who discovered a secret temple.

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires half the amount of resources or application to achieve its effect (e.g., 0.5g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound only once with half the amount of ointment, 0.5 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can do things that characters cannot. This magic can break several natural laws of the given world in a way that makes it impossible.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Either can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of total strength 8. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 8 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]].    

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 3 can do it in a few minutes (for a large wound or severe inflammation about 1 hour).    
- Light: Shines like a stadium spotlight. The light spell can be specialized to shine only on the objects the wizard wants to illuminate.    
- Cooling: Cools all rooms in an apartment building to 0 degrees. Cools a room to -20 degrees.

###### Legendary – Unreachable Level, or Level 8 -

**Rarity:** Found in legends, songs, folklore, or village rumors. This magic exists in material form only in one single -legendary- place.

**Who Knows It:** Only a legendary wizard who engages in extremely complex experiments can perform it.

**Where to Buy It:** There is only one legendary place where this magic can be bought.

**What It Can Do:** This magic breaks all the natural laws of the given world and performs things that are hard to imagine. For example, a staff of elements that can create and control any element.

###### Fairy Tale – Unreachable Level, or Level 16 -

**Rarity:** Exists only in fairy tales or in one completely hidden place.

**Who Knows It:** Only the one who discovered it, or a deity, can perform it.

**Where to Buy It:** Nowhere, or it can be bought from a deity for a high price.

**What It Can Do:** It can do things like in fairy tales. For example, a knife that opens doors to other worlds, or a ring that turns everything into sweets (like the legend of Midas).

###### Hidden – Unreachable Level, or Level 32 -

Only a deity can perform it, and they can grant this magic to any being (turning them into a messenger of the gods or a demigod). In the given world and all other worlds, it can perform things that are unimaginable.

###### Unreachable Level, or Level 64 -

This is something even gods cannot do. Only one single being across all universes can perform it. This magic can literally do anything on an infinite scale, including the destruction or creation of an entire world.

##### What a Spell Can Do (second option)

The Challenge level of a spell indicates the complexity of casting the spell. It can be determined by what the spell can accomplish. If a character is solving a problem in the story (e.g., wanting to jump over a fence) and the problem has a Challenge level (e.g., CL 3), the Challenge level of the spell does not add to the Challenge level of the problem. It is just a separate threshold the character must overcome to cast the spell (e.g., a jumping spell might have CL 2). If the character overcomes the Challenge level for casting the spell, the spell is cast, even if they do not pass the Challenge level for solving the problem. The same applies in reverse—if the character passes the CL for solving the problem but not the CL for casting the spell, they automatically fail the roll, even if they passed the CL for solving the problem.

The Challenge level for casting a spell can be determined fairly easily. In the section on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills STR\|skills]], you may notice that each skill has a list of verbs

>[!example]
>The skill "raw strength" includes verbs like (all listed in the respective section):
>
>Throw, Toss, Discard, Drop, Push, Move, Shift, Press

There is also a list of verbs for combat spells.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/z-rpg-variables/variables-mechanics/verbs-for-combat-spells/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">

>As for magical elements, they also have their own verbs. However, we write about them in [[MAG - Elements\|another place]].


</div></div>


Each verb from the skill costs 1 Challenge level (the first verb is free). So if a spell pushes someone, it will have CL 0, but if it lifts + crushes, then the spell will have CL 1. For spells where it is clear that another verb must be included (e.g., for the verb "throw away," "lift" must also be part of the spell), the CL does not increase, as the effects of the verbs occur immediately, and the whole action happens in a second (e.g., the wizard immediately lifts the enemy and then immediately throws them away). The CL of the spell increases when each verb of the spell can be performed separately (e.g., lift - keep the enemy lifted for a few seconds and then crush).

The power of the spell also increases its complexity. Each verb can perform a "human-like strength" (e.g., the spell "throw away" can throw an object as heavy and as far as a regular human can). To make the spell stronger, it must have a higher Challenge level.

One way to determine the complexity is to refer to the section [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|Other Challenge Levels]].

>[!example]
>A spell that can throw someone will have:
> - CL 1 for the verb "throw away" (since it is the first verb, it is free)
> - plus 4 CL if the object is heavy, around 80 kg (approximately the weight of a baby elephant)
> - (So the spell will have a total of CL 4)

##### By Points of Wealth (third option)

The narrator can determine the Challenge level based on what the spell should do or add (e.g., add [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] to another character). They can use the rule about [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]. In this case, all spell attributes are listed and converted to a cost according to the list below.

### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] refer to the amount of money a character carries. The number is determined by the narrator, and unless stated otherwise, every character receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6]]0 wealth points at the beginning of the game. These points can be increased when the character invests in the attribute [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] and can further be increased by selling, stealing, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward\|completing tasks]].

#### How much money should the character receive?

At the beginning of the story, each character receives a certain amount of money. Below is a list of wealth levels. The narrator determines the character's wealth level according to this list.

- Homeless: (0 - 10)
- Low-income: (11 - 20)
- Average income: (21 - 40)
- Good income: (41 - 80)
- Upper class: (81 - 160)
- High class: (161 - 320)
- Wealthier: (321 - 640)
- Rich: (641 - 1,280)
- Very rich: (1,281 - 2,560)
- Extra rich: (2,561 - 5,120)

If the narrator can't decide how much money a character should receive, they can roll dice, for example, when characters meet a wandering merchant. The number rolled on the dice is multiplied by 10 to determine how much money the other character (such as the wandering merchant) has. If it’s a very wealthy character, the narrator can roll multiple dice.

#### Consumption of wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] (p.w.) in our system are considered as money, such as euros, coins, credits. This is because they are spent in the same way as those mentioned euros, coins, credits. So if something costs, for example, 10 p.w. and the character has 30 p.w. in their pockets, after purchasing the item, the character will have only 20 p.w. left.

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

##### For Example

> [!example]
>- Leather armor, which adds 3 points of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor\|armor]] -> price 6
>- Long axe, which increases max damage by 2 -> price 4
>-  Bandage, which adds 3 dice to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Liečenie zranenia\|natural regeneration]] -> price 3
>- Healing potion, which immediately adds 2 health points -> price 8

##### Quality and Price

If the narrator wants, they can adjust the final price according to the quality or rarity. If the item is rare or of higher quality, the price increases. And if the item is damaged, or is something abundant (like sand in the desert), the price decreases.

- Trash - 16 p.w.
- Horrible / Damaged - 8 p.w.
- Bad / Very abundant item - 4 p.w.
- Worse / Abundant item - 2 p.w.
- Normal + 0 p.w. (base for all items)
- Better / Unusual + 2 p.w.
- Quality / Exceptional + 4 p.w.
- Good / Rare + 8 p.w.
- Very rare + 16 p.w.

##### Merchant Markup

The final price can also be increased by the merchant's markup. To determine it, one, two, or three dice are used (depending on how much the merchant wants to earn). The narrator rolls the dice and the value rolled:

- is added up and added to the final price of the item (when the character buys from the merchant),
- or subtracted from the final price (when the character sells something to the merchant).

#### Price in the Story

When a character wants to buy a room in a hotel, sell a car, or buy a beer—how much will they pay? The narrator can decide how to proceed.

##### First Option

The first option is that the price of an item or service is determined by the number of points (dice, or attributes) a character receives. For example, when a character rents a room in a hotel, they do so to rest and thus restore their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. The price will reflect the number of points the character restores. If it is an item that brings some benefit to the character (for example, a nice shirt adds dice to the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] skill), the number of points (or dice) the item brings to the character determines the final price.

##### Second Option

The second option is that the price is determined according to the scale:

- Cheap: 1 - 5
- Common: 5 - 9
- Pricier: 10 - 14
- Expensive: 15 - 19
- and so on

##### Third Option

The third option is that the narrator looks up the price of an item in our real world, divides it by 30, and rounds up. The minimum price of an item is always 1 p.w.

>[!example]
>A new car costs 22,000 €, so the price should be around 733 p.w.

Of course, the same applies as above. If an item or service is rare (or common) in the given world, the narrator can adjust the price of the service (see section [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - 00 - Whole Book#Quality and Price\|Quality and Price]]).

#### Earning points of Wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] increase when a character sells something, completes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Body za splnenie príbehovej úlohy\|a task]], receives a reward for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Prvá možnosť Body podľa úrovne nepriateľov\|defeating an enemy]], or performs a job. They receive their money directly from other characters. The money is added just like during consumption. So if a character has 20 p.w. and sells an item for 30, they will have 50 p.w.

#### Negotiating Prices with a Merchant

The price of an item in a shop can be lowered or increased in favor of the character. To do this, any [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used, rolled as an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active conflict]] against any of the merchant's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute. The price with the merchant can also be changed through simple conversation, or the character can solve the merchant's problem.

If a character decides they want to negotiate the price with the merchant, they choose the skill they will use (any from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used) and state how much they want to adjust the price in their favor (e.g., lower the price when buying, or increase the price when selling). For each point the character changes their price, the merchant gets that many wins added to their roll. This number is divided by 2.

> [!example] 
> For example, a character wants to change the price (in their favor) by 
> 
> 1 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 2 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 3 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 4 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 5 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 6 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 
> and so on

> [!example]
> - A character wants to buy an axe that costs 6.
> - The character wants to lower the price by 4 points.
> - The merchant gets 2 wins in their roll.

- When the price negotiation is won by the character, the price is adjusted by the amount they wanted.
- When the price negotiation is won by the merchant, the price is adjusted unfavorably for the character by the number of additional wins the merchant rolled. These wins are then multiplied by 5.

> [!example] (...continuing from the previous example)
> - The character rolled 4 wins
> - The merchant rolled 3 wins + 2 that they received
> - The merchant, therefore, rolled 1 more win than the character
> <br>
> - If the character wanted to buy the item, its price increases by 5 points
> - If the character wanted to sell the item, its price decreases by 5 points

Price negotiation can only be rolled once.

##### By Number of Victories (fourth option)

In this case, the cost of the spell is approached as if the character wants to create or upgrade an item—see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Items\|Points of Items]]. The victories from the roll are considered as money, which the character uses to buy the result for their spell. This can be according to the price listed above, or as determined by the narrator.

>[!example]  
> For example, a summoning spell
> - The number of victories from the magical roll represents the number of points that the player can invest in the stats of an elemental, golem, etc.
> 	- 1 victory point for 1 attribute point of the golem
> 		- HP (1 HP is free)
> 		- Attack (1 attack is free)
> 	- How many rounds it will exist (1 round is free)
> 		- 2 victory points for 1 attribute point of the golem
> 		- Armor (golem has no armor for free)
> - The summoned golem obeys only the player who summoned it. It does what it is told (it has some basic intelligence but no free will or soul)

### Spellcasting Failure

If a character fails the Challenge level, the narrator can decide that instead of the character casting "nothing," the spell will be weaker, something unintended happens, or the spell benefits the enemy.

If a character fails the magic roll so drastically that they roll half as many victories as needed, or roll no victories at all, a catastrophe occurs.

#### Catastrophes During Spellcasting (according to Cogent Roleplay)

A catastrophe occurs when the luck die rolls a 1.

- **Wizard Spells**    
    - **Pyromancy** - An explosion occurs, the wizard is burned - 3rd degree burns.        
    - **Hydromancy** - An explosion occurs, filling the entire room with water. The high pressure causes the wizard to suffer fractures.        
    - **Aeromancy** - The wizard creates a maximum scale tornado that cannot be stopped.        
    - **Terramancy** - The wizard creates a massive chasm or the room is swallowed by the earth.       
- **Wizard Spells - Summoning Helper - Elemental**    
    - The elemental will attack the wizard. It will not obey. It will last for 8 rounds and has 10 combat dice and 8 HP.        
- **Mage Spells**    
    - **Divination** - The mage receives a curse. Changes their (or someone else's) future to the worst possible version.        
    - **Levitation** - The mage or object flies into the air like a rocket or is cut in half (one part flies up, the other is pulled down by gravity).        
    - **Telepathy** - The mage reveals everything about themselves to the other person. Or the other person will control the mage's thoughts for 24 hours.        
    - **Teleport** - Death of the mage or destruction of the item.        
    - **Environmental Manipulation** - Catastrophic scenario. Want to increase the temperature? +3000°C. Want to cool the surroundings a bit? -2000°C.        
- **Witchcraft**    
    - **Modification** (changing the physical property of a substance) - The change will be critically large. Size change? The object will be gigantic or disappear (become microscopic). Weight change? A black hole forms.        
    - **Transformation of Objects** (changing the chemical property of a substance, or changing a poisonous potion to a healing one) - The substance turns into a corrosive acid (like the acid in the Alien movie), an explosive, or a toxic gas.        
    - **Transformation** (turning into a werewolf) - The change is permanent. Body, mind, and soul are altered.        
    - **Dominance** (controlling people remotely) - The witch is possessed by a demon or the person they are trying to control takes over their body.        
    - **Sympathy** - The two things merge together or randomly swap properties, or both are destroyed.        
- **Druidism**    
    - **Naturmancy** (controlling an animal or plant) - The controlled entity will not obey the druid and will attack.        
    - **Reflection** (reflecting a spell or transferring a property, e.g., aging from a person to a young tree, making the person younger) - The property the druid wants to get rid of becomes permanent and worsens by 2x.        
    - **Communication** (druid can communicate with animals) - The animal attacks the druid.     
- **Necromancy**    
    - **Raising the Dead** - The wizard swaps consciousness (soul) with the body they wanted to revive.        
- **Heavenly Miracles**    
    - **Restoration** (healing, cleansing) - The opposite of healing happens - greater damage or a worse illness.        
    - **Blessing** (adding attributes) - Attributes are reduced to -2.        
    - **Creation** (creating food, weapons) - The created item is rotten and diseased. The rot and poison infect with a strange magical disease that consumes them alive.        
    - **Discovery** (same as divination and telepathy for mages) - Choose a catastrophe from mages.        
    - **Mobility** (walking on water or air) - The blessed wizard is subjected to 100 G, crushing all their bones or experiencing reverse G, causing them to be flung from the planet.        
- **Other Spells** - The exact opposite of the spell occurs, or an explosion happens.    
- **Other Spells - Alternate Option** - The character loses the ability to cast the spell.

#### Catastrophes During Spellcasting (in our universe)

A catastrophe occurs whenever the character fails their dice roll. So, the luck die is not rolled.
- The spell helps the enemy.    
- Or the spell affects the character who cast it. (For example, flames burst out at the character and they start burning).    
- Or the character turns into a [[LOREGENT/Assets/Fleeting Notes/Genasi - Kúzelnárovia\|Genasi]].

### Animal Companions

Animal companions are beings that assist the character. They can be pets, "friends," "servants," or "golems." The character doesn't directly control them but gives commands that the companions can understand in their own way (according to their intelligence). Communication with animal companions often involves commands (e.g., "sit!"), sounds (e.g., whistling), body language (e.g., extending an arm forward), and similar methods.

Examples of animal companions include:

- **Pets**: cats, dogs, guinea pigs, and similar animals.    
- **Farm Animals**: cows, sheep, ducks, and similar animals.    
- **Transport Animals**: horses, camels, llamas, and similar animals.    
- **Guard Animals**: dogs, wolves, falcons, and similar animals.    
- **Constructed Beings**: golems, elementals, small personal robots    
- And other similar beings.

Animal companions play an essential role in assisting characters in various tasks, providing support, and enriching the storytelling experience.

#### Attributes of Animal Companions

Animal companions in our system are considered Unimportant Characters (the difference is that companions can have names).

#### Unimportant Character

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Character\|Unimportant Character]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Enemy\|Unimportant Enemy]]

What it is = A character stronger than extras. This character doesn’t have a name, just a single title and function.

For example = guards on the castle walls, snow demons, or like the special zombies (Spitter) in Left 4 Dead.

Permissions = One attribute (maximum two) is assigned in which points can be placed (e.g., only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]). Additionally, a talent or specialization is determined, and the character receives the same number of points in it as in the main [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]]. The number of points a character can get is determined by their level or by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

b. Attributes = Determined by level. Points can be placed in one or a maximum of two Attributes (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2 or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 1). If an odd number of points, the first attribute gets more points. There can also be characters with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attributes.

b. Skills = The character has one [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] - but no points in skills. The number of points in talent and specialization is determined by level.

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

> [!example]
> - Bear: Level 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]: 3, Talent: forest environment 3, Weapon specialization: hand protectors 3 (its claws).
> - Bear wants to knock down a tree in the forest: gets 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] + Talent
> - Bear wants to knock down a fence in the city: gets 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]

When a companion has to do something (e.g., jump over a fence), it rolls a skill check just like a character. Most dice rolls are the same as for regular characters. The difference is that the number of dice may vary (since companions do not have skill points), and if the companion has a talent for a specific environment (e.g., bear in the forest), it does not get talent dice in other environments. In combat, the companion can use talent or specialization for fighting (the character only gets dice from specialization, not talent).

> [!example]
> - Bear looks for food in the forest: gets 3 + Perception + Talent for forest environment
> - Bear looks for food in the city: gets 3 + Perception (no talent dice, as it's not in the forest).
> - Bear attacks: gets 3 + Attributes (i.e., 3 from STR) + Specialization (3 claws). Maximum damage per round is 3 (since its level is 3).

The animal companion is recorded in the character's inventory, along with all attributes and descriptions. The animal companion does not affect the character's inventory but can be used as a pack animal—considered an external inventory like a treasure chest. The companion's inventory size is determined by its level.

>[!example]
>Bear: level 3 = 3 inventory points. (It's also minus 3 for inventory weight, as the bear has STR 3)

#### Specialization for Controlling Animal Companions

To control an animal companion, a character must have a specialization directly related to that specific companion. This specialization only applies to that particular animal companion and not to another, even if it is the same animal or being.

> [!example]
> A character has a bear named Pooh as their pet. In the character table, they write the specialization "Bear Pooh." This specialization is tied only to "Pooh" and not to another bear.

Specialization is necessary for the character to fully control their companion. Therefore, they must invest points in specialization according to the companion's level.

>[!example]
>- Bear Pooh is level 3. Therefore, the character must have 3 points in their specialization.

When the character has the required number of points to control the companion, they do not need to roll any control checks before the companion's roll—the companion simply rolls their dice.

If the character does not have the required number of points, the companion still rolls their dice, but the number of dice is reduced by the number of points the character lacks in their specialization.

If the character has more points than required, the companion gains extra dice.

> [!example]
>The character wants Bear Pooh to knock down a tree. Bear Pooh is level 3.
>
>If the character has 3 points in their specialization, Bear Pooh rolls the dice (the character does not roll).
>
>If the character has 1 point in their specialization, Bear Pooh rolls the dice (the character does not roll), but loses 2 dice from their roll (because Bear Pooh is level 3 - 1 specialization point = minus 2 dice).
>
>If the character has 4 points in their specialization, Bear Pooh rolls the dice (the character does not roll), but gains 1 extra die (because Bear Pooh is level 3 - 4 specialization points = plus 1 die).

If the companion fails the dice roll, they may misunderstand the command and, for example, attack someone else, knock down the wrong tree, or knock down the tree onto the character.

#### Challenge Level for Controlling an Animal Companion

Each animal companion has its own level (tier) that indicates its strength and abilities. The level of the animal is determined by the following list. (Note: the level of a golem or a being summoned by a spell is determined by the number of successes rolled by the character).

**Size**
- Like a mouse (7 - 12 cm) = level + 0    
- Like a cat (20 cm - 45 cm) = level + 1    
- Like a dog (45 cm - 80 cm) = level + 1    
- Like a lion (100 cm - 200 cm) = level + 2    
- Like a horse (140 cm - 240 cm) = level + 2    
- Like a bear (140 cm - 280 cm) = level + 3    
- Like an elephant (550 cm - 650 cm) = level + 4    
- Larger = level + 5    
- Even larger = level + 6    

**Education**
- Wild = level + 0    
- Domesticated = level + 1    
- Trained = level + 2    
- Professionally trained (e.g., police dog) = level + 3    

**Age**
- Juvenile = level + 0    
- Adult = level + 1    
- Senior = level + 2    

**Magical Properties**
- None = level + 0    
- According to the level of magic

### Monsters from Pocket

Monsters from Pocket are, well, monsters that live in a world created by the narrator. These monsters have a purpose, forming part of the ecosystem and food chain. Besides solving human problems (like on a farm), they also engage in battles, as they possess magical abilities and can cast various spells.

In our RPG system, magical monsters (referred to as monsters) are considered "unimportant characters." Their dice rolls work similarly to other characters, as do their points, but their attributes and skills differ slightly.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/03-character/character-in-general/rpg-groups-of-characters/#unimportant-character" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].


</div></div>


#### Attributes, Level, Evolution

Each monster, like any other character, has basic attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]). These attributes receive points based on the monster's level and evolution. The level indicates how many points the monster can distribute among its attributes (1 point per level). Evolution determines how many attributes the monster can allocate points to.

>[!example]
>
>Monster Level 3, Evolution A: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 3
>Monster Level 5, Evolution B: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 2
>Monster Level 8, Evolution C: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] 2

Each monster (and its evolution) has predetermined attributes to allocate points to. It doesn't have to start with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], it could be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] or another attribute. Monsters can have various attribute combinations, such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]. The narrator determines the monster's attributes when creating them for the game.

Each monster is assigned a primary attribute. This attribute receives the most points, especially when the number of points is odd. The remaining attributes receive points according to their order.

However, the trainer character can ignore this rule. When the monster levels up, they can invest a point in any attribute.

##### Level and Evolution

Each monster in our RPG system has three evolutions representing stages of maturity. The first evolution is a juvenile, the second is akin to an adolescent, and the third is adulthood. Each evolution has a set maximum level. When a monster surpasses this level, it evolves to the next stage.

>[!example]
>* Evolution A: Minimum level 1, maximum 4
>* Evolution B: Minimum level 5, maximum 8
>* Evolution C: Minimum level 9, maximum 99

###### Experience

Monsters gain experience by defeating enemies or through training (see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Training\|chapter on training]], attribute training rule). After accumulating 1000 points, a monster advances by 1 level. Each time a level is gained, the monster receives 1 point to invest in one of its attributes.

For each enemy defeated, a monster earns:

- 10 training points (as a base)    
- Plus points for the difference between the monster's level and its enemy's level:   
- Enemy's level minus monster's level, times 10
- If the difference is negative, then 0

##### Monsters and Attributes

Monsters can utilize all basic attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]). However, the number of attributes into which they can allocate points is determined by their evolution.

- Evolution A - only one attribute    
- Evolution B - only two attributes    
- Evolution C - only three attributes

The narrator decides which attributes the monster can use (when creating monsters for their world). Some monsters may have various combinations of attributes, such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]].

When a monster gains 1 point in an attribute, it gains:

- **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] adds or subtracts:**    
    - +/- 1 die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills STR\|strength skills]]        
    - +/- 1 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Health Points]]        
- **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] adds or subtracts:**    
    - +/- 1 die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills REF\|reflex skills]]        
    - +/- 1 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Speed Points]]        
- **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] adds or subtracts:**    
    - +/- 1 die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills INT\|intelligence skills]]        
    - !! +/- 1 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]        
- **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] adds or subtracts:**    
    - +/- 1 die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|social skills]]        
    - +/- 1 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Wealth Points]]

##### Points and Monsters

Monsters can use character points as follows:

- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each monster has 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]].            
        - Plus 1 point for each level            
        - Plus 1 point for each point invested in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] attribute.            
    - Health regeneration:        
        - Monsters can [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Liečenie zranenia\|regenerate]] using their spell, recovering full [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] (not fractions).        
        - Trainers can regenerate the monster directly in battle or out of battle using a magical item (the monster will receive full health points).          
        - Monsters can fully heal at a healing center (in a city). The cost for healing 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/HP\|HP]] is 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] from the trainer.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each monster has 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].            
        - Plus 1 for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].

##### Monsters, Talent, and Skills

Monsters cannot allocate points to talents, specializations, or skills. They can roll for skills normally, with a roll of 3 + the Attribute of the skill.

#### Types of Monsters

Monsters are categorized by their attack type (melee or ranged), their element (e.g., fire or water), and the animal they resemble (e.g., snake or bear).

The most significant impact on gameplay is the attack type and element, which determine how the monster will attack, what spells it will have, and which element it will be disadvantaged against. The type of monster (e.g., ground or flying) is more important for appearance and story, though some types may have additional attacks (e.g., birds may have aerial attacks).

##### Monsters by Movement Type

Each monster moves in a specific way. This has more of a narrative impact than a combat one.

- Ground Type: Monster moves on the ground    
    - Two Legs: Like a monkey or an animal with four legs that walks on two.        
    - Four Legs: Like a cat or dog, etc.        
    - Crawling/Swimming/Flowing: A monster that resembles a snake, or one that can swim in water but crawls on land, or a liquid or jelly that flows.        
    - Levitating/No Legs/Hopping: A monster that levitates a few centimeters above the ground. It's as if it has legs, but doesn't. It may also move by hopping.        
- Flying Type: Monster flies in the air like a bird, or levitates in the air like a bird.    

If the narrator wants the movement type to affect gameplay, they can decide that ground types get +2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] and flying types get +2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] (regardless of the monster's level or evolution).

##### Monsters by Attack Type

Each monster has its weapons (hands, claws, tail, etc.) with which it attacks. These basic weapons follow the same rules as all weapons in LW RPG. The same applies to their spells.

###### Weapon and Armor Types

In battles with monsters, elements and attack types like "sharp weapons, blunt weapons," etc., determine whether the monster fights with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|advantage]] / [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]], and how much damage they take.

###### Weapons and Distance

In battles with monsters, spells and weapons follow the same rules as any other weapons in LW RPG. A slight exception is the rule for the complexity of hitting with a ranged weapon. Monster spells do not have a basic complexity level (e.g., medium firearms have a CL of 2), but each ranged spell uses the complexity table based on distance, target's movement speed, and cover (see table).

###### Distances

In battles with monsters, all distances are used except for “Even further” and “Far away.”

#### Elements

Each monster can have only one element.

Elements affect the monster's appearance (e.g., the monster is burning) and attack (even the basic one). This is important because each monster is sensitive to one element and resistant to another. In this document, we will use elements created within LW RPG; however, the narrator can create their own system. In LW RPG, we use primary elements, expanded elements, composite elements, and pseudo-elements. To make this clear, we have created the following list, where we have selected some elements, categorizing each under the main element, according to which sensitivity is determined.

***Fire**
- Fire    
- Lava    
- Plasma    
- Electricity    
- Hot chocolate    
- Anything with higher temperature or functioning like electricity    

**Water**
- Water    
- Snow    
- Ice    
- Ice cream    
- Jelly candies    
- Mud    
- Plants / fungi    
- All liquids or semi-liquids (milk, blood, wine, porridge, etc.)    

**Earth**
- Earth    
- Rock    
- Metal    
- Beetle (poison, acid)    
- Trash / rot    
- Solid candies (caramel)    
- All minerals and solid things (diamond, gold, etc.)    

**Wind**
- Wind    
- Tornado    
- Ghost    
- Sound, vibrations, frequency (known as element Darkness in LW)    
- Marshmallow    
- Anything airy and ethereal    

**Physics (Physical Force)**
- Life (organics / flesh)    
- Chance    
- Time    
- Gravity (magnetism)    
- Radiation (known as element Light in LW)    
- Telekinesis    
- Anything that is a physical force or psychic force

###### Relationship Between Elements

In combat, each monster with an element can be either weak or resistant to another element. This weakness or resistance affects the attack outcome.

When a monster attacks an enemy whose element is **weak** against the attacker's element:

- The monster rolls with advantage (i.e., a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 counts as a win for that die).    
- The enemy rolls with disadvantage (i.e., only a roll of 5 or 6 counts as a win for that die).    

When a monster attacks an enemy whose element is **strong** against the attacker's element:

- The monster rolls with disadvantage (i.e., only a roll of 5 or 6 counts as a win for that die).    
- The enemy rolls with advantage (i.e., a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 counts as a win for that die).    

When a monster attacks an enemy whose element is **the same** as the attacker's element, the dice are rolled normally (without advantage or disadvantage).

>[!example]
>
>* The attacker has the Water element, and the enemy has the Fire element.
>* The attacker rolls with advantage (i.e., a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 counts as a win for that die).
>* The enemy rolls with disadvantage (i.e., only a roll of 5 or 6 counts as a win for that die).

##### Armor Type

Similar to characters, monsters also follow the rule regarding weapon and armor types. Each monster can have only one type of weapon and one type of armor, and these types can be different—they don't have to be the same.

>[!example]
>Floraculla - weapon: fangs = piercing melee weapon, armor = resistant to blunt

Armor effectiveness against damage indicates how well the armor mitigates enemy damage. Armors are categorized by their effectiveness against weapons as follows:

### Armor

Armor is a passive protection that shields a character from damage in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]] or during a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|quick solution to the situation]]. The number of armor points is determined by the narrator. Unless otherwise specified, every character receives **0 armor points**.

Armor can be increased with items like helmets, gloves, or bulletproof vests. Armor can also be permanently increased by a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk\|natural trait]] the character is born with (e.g., a turtle's shell).

There is no maximum armor level, but it can only be reduced to zero. Armor does not go into negative numbers.

#### How Armor Works

Unless otherwise specified, armor is a passive protection that shields [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] by reducing the damage a character would receive from an attacker.

>[!example]
>- The enemy rolls 6 victories in their combat roll
>- The character rolls 2 victories in their combat roll.
> <br>
>- The character's health points should decrease by 4 points.
>- However, the character has 3 armor points.
>- Therefore, their health points decrease by only 1.

Although armor reduces damage, it does not reduce the victory level. So if a character wins the combat roll but does not cause any injury to the enemy, they can use other options listed in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|chapter on victory levels]].

#### Armor Strength

Each piece of protective gear adds armor points directly. All armor points (even from multiple items) are then totaled together. So if a character is wearing, for example, a helmet +1, body armor +3, and boots +2, their armor score would be 6. Armor is calculated separately only when an enemy or character decides to attack a specific part of the body (e.g., attacking the hands).

The armor level of a given item is not judged by the period or genre in which the story takes place. Whether it's medieval, sci-fi, or magical - an armor level of 1 represents weak or small armor, and a level of 5 represents large or high-quality armor.

1. Weak or small armor    
2. Below-average armor or medium armor    
3. Average armor or standard size    
4. Above-average armor or larger    
5. High-quality armor or largest

#### Armor Specialization

All information on specialization can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization#Specialization and Armor\|relevant chapter]]. But in short: the number of points a character invests in specialization for a certain type of armor (e.g., samurai armor) increases their armor points for that specific armor when equipped.

Armor specialization must be tied to a job, type of martial arts, or specific magic. A character cannot have a general light armor specialization for all kinds of light armor but must specify the type, such as light samurai armor.

#### Types of Armor

However, the rating of armor does not end with a number. Each armor must also have its type specified, which indicates which type of weapon the armor is resistant to and which it is weak against. In our RPG system, we divide armor by resistance (against weapons) into three types:

- **Light Armor**: resistant to one type of weapon. It has a weight of 1, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to multiple skills.    
- **Medium Armor**: resistant to two types of weapons. Its weight is 2, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to one skill.    
- **Heavy Armor**: resistant to three types of weapons. Its weight is 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it cannot add points to skills.    

This resistance can manifest in the game in various ways. Either the light armor gets damaged after each successful enemy attack, or the light armor won't protect the character as well. The narrator can decide which method to use, create their own method, or combine multiple methods.

##### Armor Damage

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain type of weapon. After each successful enemy attack, the armor is slightly damaged, reducing the armor points by 1. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the weak armor takes full damage.    
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain type of weapon. Therefore, it does not get damaged during a successful enemy attack. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the resistant armor takes only half damage.    
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)    

Damaged armor can be repaired by a blacksmith, or if the character has the appropriate talent and tools, they can repair the armor themselves.

##### Armor Effectiveness

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 2 armor points block only 1 damage point.    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is weak against the given weapon). The enemy receives 3 damage points.        
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 1 armor point blocks 2 damage points (i.e., the number of damage points is halved, rounded down).    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is resistant to the given weapon). The enemy receives 0 damage points.        
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)

##### In Our Universe

In our story universe, armor is divided according to the type of weapon attack it faces (see the list):

###### Against Blunt Weapons and Explosives
- This armor is resistant to blunt weapons and explosives. This means that blunt weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Blunt Weapons\|Blunt Weapons]] are: hammers, maces, clubs, and similar. Also includes blunt throwing weapons.)    
- (Explosives fall under [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Explosive Weapons\|Explosive Weapons]]. These include: grenades, explosive arrows, explosive spells, and similar.)

###### Against Sharp Weapons
- This armor is resistant to sharp weapons. This means that sharp weapons do not harm this armor. 
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Sharp Weapons\|Sharp Weapons]] are: axes, swords, katanas, knives, shurikens, and similar. Also includes sharp throwing weapons.)

###### Against Piercing Weapons
- This armor is resistant to piercing weapons. This means that piercing weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- Applies to ranged and stabbing weapons.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Piercing Weapons\|Ranged Weapons]] are: arrows, bullets—everything shot from a weapon (not throwing weapons).    
- (Stabbing weapons: rapiers, spears, and other weapons designed for stabbing.)

###### Mixed Armor
- A character's armor is "mixed" when they wear pieces of various types of armor on their body.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

 ###### Without Armor
- A character is "without armor" when they have no items or clothing on their body that could be considered armor. Or when it is natural armor, like a turtle's shell.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

#### Armor and Elements

In our universe, the rule is that every armor is weak against all elements unless it has magical resistance against a particular element.

Regarding elements in general, our story universe follows the rule that all elements are equal. This means that no element is inherently weak against another element.

However, if the narrator wants certain elements to be stronger or weaker against each other (similar to the game Pokémon), they can follow the chapter on "[[RPG - Pocket Monsters#Elements\|Pocket Monsters]]."

#### Energy Armor

This is protection that uses energy (magic or photons) instead of solid materials (such as iron). Energy armor functions similarly to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]. When a character takes damage, their energy armor points are depleted before their health points. Once the energy armor is depleted, the character is no longer protected.

Such armor can also be recharged. The method depends on the story (sometimes a specific item or battery is needed, or if it's magic, the shield is charged from the character's energy through a spell). The narrator sets the limitations of energy armor and its recharging options. The narrator may decide that the armor can be recharged automatically after combat or, in certain cases (using a spell or item), even during combat.

Energy armor does not affect the character's weight. Some weapons may be more effective against it (meaning some weapons deplete 2 or 3 points instead of 1). Some elements may completely ignore it (e.g., a poisonous cloud that depletes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] directly).

In close combat, energy armor functions normally.

#### Magical Armor Abilities

Magical properties of armor are special abilities that provide additional protection or advantage to a character. To activate these properties, the character must meet certain conditions. Some magical properties are activated by spells, or a combination of talent, skill, or specialization. Other magical properties are activated when certain numbers or ranges of numbers are rolled on the dice.

> [!example]
> * **Thorn Armor** - When a 1 is rolled on the dice, the enemy receives as much damage as the number of dice with a 1.
> * **Ice Armor** - Reduces the speed of nearby characters by 1 point (speed) for as many rounds as the character rolled victories.
> * **Spider Armor** - The character can use the "pull" spell. It combines Dexterity + specialization in Spider Armor. The character chooses a target, and the narrator determines the difficulty level.

These magical properties can only be activated when the character has a specialization for a specific type of armor. So if the character has a specialization in heavy armor and is wearing heavy armor with magical properties, they can use the magical properties. If they had a different armor, they could not. The number of points invested in specialization adds dice to the roll or shifts the activation threshold.

- Specialization 1, 2 = when a 1 is rolled    
- Specialization 3, 4 = when a 1, 2 is rolled    
- Specialization 5, 6 = when a 1, 2, 3 is rolled (3 is the maximum)

> [!example]
> For protective properties, numbers 1, 2, 3 are used. For supportive or offensive properties, numbers 4, 5, 6 are used.

As for the cost, magical properties are considered armor points. So if heavy armor has 3 armor points and magical properties add 2 points, the cost will be the same as if the heavy armor had 5 armor points.

In terms of weight, magical properties do not count towards the weight. However, the narrator can change this and, for example, increase the armor's weight.

#### Combat, Attack, and Spells

In our RPG system, battles with monsters follow the same rules as battles with any other characters, with a few modifications.

At the start of the battle, each trainer selects one monster to fight. In each round, the trainer whose monster has the least speed points announces what their monster will do. The trainer whose monster has the most speed points then announces what their monster will do, and can react to the "slower" trainer's decision (which cannot be changed).

Dice are rolled, and the monster with the most successes wins the round. The number of successes the monster rolled is subtracted from the enemy's successes, and the remainder becomes the victory level. Based on this level, the monster deals damage to the enemy.

A monster that loses all health points is out of the battle. The winner (both the monster and its trainer) gains experience equal to the victory amount. The defeated trainer can choose another monster to continue fighting. The winner can also change their monster or choose not to (if they decide not to change, they can use 1 item without affecting the number of actions their monster has in that round).

A trainer with no remaining monsters is out of the battle completely. They are also out if they decide to flee.

>[!info]
>Alternatively, two monsters and the trainer can join the battle to fight side by side.

#### Combat Actions

In each round, a monster can perform one slow action (or two quick actions). If a trainer decides to engage in combat (e.g., using a healing potion), the monster loses one quick action (since each trainer action is a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers#List of Maneuvers\|quick action]]).

Activities involving the use of consumable items (e.g., healing potions or armor-boosting potions) or blessings from the trainer (which have the same effect as potions) can be performed by the trainer before the monster and enemy attacks.

Activities involving switching monsters or purchasing an additional action in combat (where the first attack is considered a supporting roll for the second attack) can only be performed by the trainer after the monster and enemy attacks.

##### Maximum Damage

The rule on maximum damage to the enemy does not apply to monsters.

#### Spell Attributes

Spells in combat are used to damage enemies, defend the monster, restore its points, or gain some advantage. These spells are abilities that the monster knows inherently and do not need to be learned. The only limitations on the number of spells a monster can use are its Evolution and Element. Spells have no weight and do not need to be "equipped" in order to be used (unlike a sword).

In addition to these primary attributes (Evolution and Element), spells also have other attributes, such as weapon type, action type, formula for calculating the number of dice the monster can roll, and the result.

##### Spell Evolution

Evolution limits the spells a monster can use. A monster in Evolution A cannot use spells from Evolution B or C. Conversely, a monster in Evolution C can use spells from Evolution A and B. Evolution also affects the attack calculation and the spell cost.

##### Spell Cost

A monster must sacrifice a few points to use a spell.

- Basic Attack = 0 points    
- Spell Evolution A = 1 point    
- Spell Evolution B = 2 points    
- Spell Evolution C = 3 points

A monster can use wealth points, speed points, and health points to purchase spells. The cost for each spell is fixed and does not change due to points. If a monster lacks sufficient points, it can use the Basic Attack, which replenishes points. (Details on the Basic Attack can be found in the spell list).

##### Spell Element

Each spell must specify the element it is intended for (e.g., water) and may also specify a sub-element (e.g., freezing). If a spell is intended for a specific sub-element, a monster of the main element or a different sub-element cannot use that spell at all.

Exceptions are spells (attacks) that can be used by monsters of all elements. These include the Basic Attack.

##### Weapon Type

In most cases, the weapon type of a spell matches the weapon type of the monster. So if a monster has a blunt melee weapon, its spells will also be blunt melee weapons. Some spells may change this type, but this is rare.

##### Action Type

In the vast majority of cases, each spell and maneuver is a slow action.

>[!note]
>Monsters can use all appropriate maneuvers from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|chapter on maneuvers]]. However, they will always be slow actions.

##### Number of Dice

Each spell must specify how to calculate the number of dice the monster can roll.

This number is calculated from the basic attack, which is 3 + "number of dice from the item in the monster's inventory that adds to the attack."

Higher evolution spells can use multiple attributes in their roll.
- Evolution A Spell can use only one attribute, e.g., just STR    
- Evolution B Spell can use two attributes, e.g., just REF and SOC    
- Evolution C Spell can use three attributes, e.g., just STR, REF, and INT    

Higher evolution spells can use an attribute multiple times.

>[!example]
>
>Evolution A Spell ... + 1 x STR
>Evolution B Spell ... + 2 x STR
>Evolution C Spell ... + 3 x STR

###### Choosing Attributes for Spells

Attributes for spells are chosen based on what activity or skill they resemble, or by which point they influence.

For higher evolutions, the choice of attribute depends more on the narrator's intuition, and whether the spell uses only one skill or includes a second or third skill (e.g., whether brute strength also uses agility). Alternatively, the spell may continue to strengthen only one skill.

##### Spell Outcome

A monster can affect either itself, the enemy, or both with its spell.

Each spell can only affect one type of point or combat attribute. Regarding points, a spell can affect Health Points, Speed Points, and Armor. Concerning combat attributes, a spell can affect attack strength, the number of actions per round (each monster can take one slow action, which a spell can reduce or increase), and the number of spells a monster can use (e.g., blocking Evolution C spells even if the monster is of the highest evolution).

Spells can also have passive effects. These activate when a die shows a 1 (for defensive spells) or a 6 (for offensive spells). The strength of the effect depends on the evolution.

- Evolution A Spell can have a very weak passive effect (1 point) that lasts 1 round  
- Evolution B Spell can have a weak passive effect (1 point) activated by a die number, lasting 1 round.    
- Evolution C Spell can have a strong passive effect (1-3 points) activated by a die number, lasting 1 round, or weaker effects (1 point) lasting until the end of the round.    

Spells do not have a status effect (like poison, where a monster loses 1 HP per round). Each spell has an effect that lasts until the next round or until the end of the battle (e.g., poison limits the monster's health points by 1, meaning that point cannot be healed by any spell).

#### Spell Examples

##### For All Elements and Monsters

These spells can be used by monsters of all elements. The monster's element transfers to the attack, meaning if the monster is, for example, fire-elemental, its basic attack will also be fire-elemental. If the monster is water-elemental, its basic attack will also be water-elemental.

###### Basic Attack (All Monsters)

Evolution All (cost 0)    
Element According to the monster's element   
Weapon Type According to the monster's weapon    
Action Slow Action

Dice Roll: 3 dice + item from the monster's inventory that adds to the attack 
Result: Damage to the enemy + restoration of speed points + attack repetition

Description:

The monster attacks the enemy, dealing damage. The monster restores 1 speed point + 1 point for each damage dealt to the enemy (so at least 1).

If a 6 is rolled, the monster can roll again (the number of successes is added to the previous roll's successes).

If two 6s are rolled in the repeated roll, the monster can go again (the number of successes is added to the previous roll).

If three 6s are rolled in the next repeated roll, the monster can roll once more (the number of successes is added to the previous rolls).

And so on.

If the trainer does not have talent in controlling the monster, the basic attack does not lose any dice. However, the monster cannot roll multiple times in succession, even if a 6 is rolled.

The basic attack is also used to calculate the dice roll for all other spells. The rule for restoring speed points applies only to the basic attack.

###### Strong Attack (All Monsters, A)

Evolution: A (cost 1)
Element: According to the monster's element
Weapon Type: According to the monster's weapon

Element: According to the monster's element
Weapon Type: According to the monster's weapon

Action: Slow Action

Dice Roll: Basic attack + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] Result: Damage to the enemy + blocking the enemy's attack

Description: The monster attacks the enemy, dealing damage. If the dice roll wins, the monster goes first. This means that even if the enemy has an unavoidable attack or one that affects the area and causes the monster a problem, the quick attack blocks it.

##### Water

###### Cold Attack (Ice, Cold, A)

Evolution: A (cost 1)
Element: Water - all cold and frozen elements
Weapon Type: According to the monster's weapon

Action: Slow Action

Dice Roll: Basic attack + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]

Result: The monster damages the enemy and simultaneously slows them down in the next round (reducing their priority in combat as if they had lower [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]). This slowdown lasts for one round and renews each time the monster hits the enemy.

###### Freezing Attack (Ice, Cold, B)

Evolution: B (cost 2)
Element: Water - all cold and frozen elements
Weapon Type: According to the monster's weapon

Action: Slow Action

Dice Roll: Basic attack + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]]

Result: The monster damages the enemy. Each 6 rolled reduces the enemy's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] by 1 point in the next round (affecting speed points, attacks, and combat order).

###### Absorb (Plant, B)

Evolution: B (cost 2)
Element: Water - Plant (only for plant-type)
Weapon Type: According to the monster's weapon

Action: Slow Action

Dice Roll: Basic attack + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]

Result: The monster steals a portion of the enemy's health points for itself. The amount stolen depends on the number of successes. Each 6 rolled increases the amount of health restored by +1 (but does not increase damage to the enemy).

##### Earth

###### Hardening (Universal Earth, A)

Evolution: A (cost 1)
Element: Earth - for all Earth elements
Weapon Type: None, the monster casts the spell on itself

Action: Slow Action

Dice Roll: Basic attack + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]

Result: The monster absorbs the enemy's attack, taking no damage. The number of successes rolled in the next round becomes armor. The armor lasts for one round.

###### Greater Hardening (Universal Earth, B)

Evolution: B (cost 2)
Element: Earth - for all Earth elements
Weapon Type: None, the monster casts the spell on itself

Action: Slow Action

Dice Roll: Basic attack + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]

Result: The monster absorbs the enemy's attack, taking no damage. The number of successes rolled becomes armor. The armor lasts for one round. Each 1 rolled increases the number of rounds the armor lasts by +1.

#### Trainer, Talent, and Specialization

A trainer is a character who owns a monster. They are responsible for training it (according to training rules) and other care (such as healing outside of combat). During combat, the trainer gives commands to their monster, such as which attack to use or when to hide. Additionally, the trainer can add items to the monster's inventory, enhancing its attributes or points. These items can only be added or swapped outside of combat.

Regarding talents and occupations, a trainer must have a talent to utilize their monster effectively. As long as the talent is connected to the monster's primary element (e.g., fire), it automatically applies to sub-elements as well. Occupations are more voluntary and provide the trainer with ways to approach their monster (e.g., a scientist can better identify them, or a doctor can heal them). Occupations are listed separately and are not related to the monster's element.

Specialization works a bit differently. It acts as an inventory where monsters are stored (similar to Poké Balls on a belt). So whenever a trainer captures a monster, they record it in the character table under specializations. Without this, they cannot control the monster.

##### Talent

A trainer needs a talent connected to the primary element of the monster (which automatically applies to sub-elements as well). Without this talent, the monster receives no additional dice from specialization in combat, or (if the narrator decides) the monster loses 2 dice from each roll. Talents apply not only in combat (e.g., when the trainer wants to use a healing item) but also outside it (e.g., when the trainer wants their monster to knock down a tree) or even on other monsters (e.g., when hiding from a wild monster in the forest).

In some activities, talents can be combined. For example, a talent for fire monsters and a talent as a monster healer can be combined when the trainer wants to heal a fire monster.

##### Specialization

In a standard game, specializations are used to enhance the monster, as the number of points the trainer invests in specialization (for a particular monster) increases the number of dice the monster gets in combat. The narrator can decide whether this specialization applies to a specific monster (like Lakti) or to an element or sub-element.

In the LW world, if a trainer wants to own a monster and send it into combat, they must invest 1 point in specialization (it is mandatory). This specialization acts as an inventory where the trainer stores monsters. Whenever the trainer captures a monster, they must deduct 1 point from another skill to invest in the specialization and thus gain the monster.

However, this specialization applies only to that one monster. For example, if a trainer has 10 monsters, they must create a separate specialization for each one (e.g., "Firruzli 1b"). The trainer can also invest additional points in specializations when they level up (gain 1000 experience points), without restriction on where the points are allocated (even if currently fighting with Firruzli and leveling up, they can allocate the point elsewhere, e.g., to Lakti). However, a trainer can invest a maximum of 4 points in one monster.

Specialization adds an extra die for the specified monster in combat.

If the trainer permanently loses a monster, they regain only one point from the specialization (the remaining points are lost).

##### Experience

The trainer gains the same amount of experience as the monster. This experience is equally divided between the trainer and the monster. However, the trainer must reach 1000 points to add another point to the talent or to the monster's specialization.

#### Catching Monsters

The narrator can determine how monsters are captured and under what conditions. However, it's always true that only wild monsters can be caught, not those belonging to another trainer.

In the LW world, there are no balls or other containers. Trainers catch monsters by defeating them (bringing their health points to 0) and then touching them while saying a capture spell. To summon the monster from their soul again, they must say the monster's name and a summoning spell. When the monster is in the soul, time stops for it, as if it ceases to exist until summoned again. This means that to fully heal or change the monster's inventory, the trainer must summon it. Additionally, if the monster is poisoned, its health points do not deplete.

Even when the monster is in the soul, its health, speed points, and wealth slowly regenerate at a rate of 1 point every 24 hours (points regenerate simultaneously, so 1 point for health, speed, and wealth each).

The trainer does not receive any negative statuses from the monster (such as poison or disease). The monster's status is cured after 24 hours in the soul.

If the trainer dies, their monsters disappear.

#### Random Encounters

Random encounters occur in the wild or other abandoned places where wild monsters live. The narrator determines locations where monsters might be found (and their types). When a trainer passes through these locations, they roll for luck.

1. Monster with a level higher by 6
2. Monster with a level higher by 4
3. Monster with a level higher by 2
4. No monster, or a monster with a level lower by 2
5. No monster, or a monster with a level lower by 4
6. No monster, or a monster the trainer wants to catch, or something rare

### Civilizations

The rules concerning civilizations are used when there are multiple factions in the game world. These factions can compete, form alliances, or wage wars. All rules and mechanics that apply to regular characters also apply to civilizations. Of course, there can be exceptions or changes in these rules, and therefore, we will remind you and describe how they differ.

#### Factions

In our RPG system, factions or civilizations include: states, groups, political parties, guilds (e.g., a thieves' guild), religious groups, trade chains, and so on. Factions always have someone who governs them – it can be a god, emperor, king, boss, or even a parliament.

When a character or city is a member of a faction, they gain (or lose) points in attributes, skills, and talents. Each faction has a certain number of points (a certain setup) that applies to them.

>[!info] 
>Specifically :
> -  Attributes: Each faction has two attributes. One attribute has a value of +1 and the other attribute has a value of -1.
> -  And the faction can choose from the following options:
> 	-  Either choose skills, where one skill can have +4 or two skills +2. While one other skill must have -4 or two skills -2
> 	-  Or choose talents, where one talent can have +4 or two talents +2. While one other talent must have -4 or two talents -2 (those that are important in the given world).
> 	-  Or choose spells, where one unique spell can have +4 or two unique spells +2. While one other spell must have -4 or two spells -2 (those that are important in the given world).
> 	- Or combine these options, where the faction can have, for example, one skill +2 and one talent +2. While one spell will have -2 and another skill -2.

#### City Attributes

>[!note]
> Although we write about a city, it also applies to entities like branches and such. So, places where more people work for a civilization or company.

Civilizations are made up of cities. Companies have branches, and organizations have departments. All these cities, branches, and departments are entities that work for their civilization (faction, company, etc.). The civilization, faction, or company itself does not do any work, it only gives orders.

The activities are carried out by the entities (i.e., cities, branches, departments, etc.). Therefore, these entities have their own attributes, just like any other character in our RPG system, following the same rules (though with some exceptions). This means that attributes change the number of dice when rolling for skills, change the number of dice in combat rolls, and also change the number of points the entity (i.e., city, branch, department, etc.) actually has. However, these attributes are adjusted according to the main attribute settings of the faction.

>[!example]
>When a player creates a character that will be part of a faction ruled by the god of war, their attributes at the start of character creation might be set like this:
>
>* plus 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] (strength) and minus 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] (intelligence)
>* plus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] axe fighting and plus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]
>* minus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]] and minus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]
>
> The player can invest points as they wish, but the character has this basic setup.

##### City Size

The size and level of a city are evaluated based on the number of points in its attributes.

> [!example] Example levels and sizes of cities:
>* Settlement - 1, 2, 3
>* Village - 4, 5, 6
>* Town - 7, 8, 9
>* Large City - 10, 11, 12
>* Metropolis - 13, 14, 15
>* and so on.

Whether a city is more of a settlement, village, or large city is mainly important for the story. As for the rules, the level (size) of the city limits the number of points it can improve. Let's imagine that a city has 1 point in all attributes - that is level 1 (in this case a Small Settlement). If the city is at level 1, it can improve a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] by a total of 1 point. No more. Conversely, if the city is at level 10, it can improve its skills, talents, or specializations by up to 10 points. This means the total number of points in skills, talents, and specializations will be 10.

>[!example]
> - A level 2 Village may not have any skill improved
> - A level 2 Village may have an improved skill such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] 1 (meaning it has improved by 1 point and can improve by 1 more point)
> - A level 2 Village may have improved skills such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] 1 and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] 1 (meaning it has improved by 2 points, which is the maximum)
> - A level 2 Village cannot have an improved skill such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] 2 and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] 1 (because that is 3 points, while the maximum is 2)

When a city can no longer improve its skills (or talents or specializations), it must improve one of its attributes (to increase its level and be able to improve something else again).

##### City Attributes

Cities can use all basic attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]). When a city receives 1 point in an attribute, it gets:

- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills STR\|strength skills]]        
    - +/- 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]        
    - +/- 1 in weight [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Inventory\|inventory]] ( [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] decreases the total inventory weight)        
- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills REF\|reflex skills]]        
    - +/- 1 in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed points]]        
- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills INT\|intelligence skills]]        
    - +/- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] points in each [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|training roll]]        
- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|social skills]]        
    - +/- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] points in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|wealth points]]        
- One point in any attribute:    
    - +/- 1 in combat roll and magic roll        
    - +/- 1 in health points

##### Points and the City

Mestá môžu používať body postavy a to nasledovne.:

Cities can use character points as follows:

- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has 4 health points.            
        - Plus 1 point for each point invested in all attributes.            
    - Health regeneration:        
        - Cities [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Healing injuries\|regenerate]] like characters. A city rolls a regeneration roll during its "turn."            
        - One city can repair another city.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has 4 speed points            
        - Plus 1 for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]            
    - Usage:        
        - Determines the order in combat or activity.            
        - Cities are constantly in combat in a sense, so combat rules are always followed, even if combat rolls are not made, but rather improvements (i.e., training skills or attributes).     
        - Used to purchase actions during a turn. 2 points allow a city to perform 1 slow action.    
        - (All city actions are slow actions).            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has 4 wealth points            
        - Plus 5 for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]            
    - Usage:        
        - These points are used when cities trade with each other.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - (Inventory consumes speed points)            
        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] reduces the total weight of the inventory by 1            
        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] adds 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed point ]]           
    - Usage:        
        - Items that increase skill points, talents, or specializations can be placed in the inventory. They may also increase basic attack, armor, or points (e.g., health, which is increased through specializations).            
        - Items that increase basic attributes do not exist.            
        - The weight of each item is determined by its price. A brief summary:            
            - If an item adds 1 die = weight 1                
                - (Die for skills and talents)                    
            - If an item adds 1 attack = weight 2                
            - If an item adds 1 armor = weight 3                
        - Armies are not counted in the inventory, as they are considered separate characters (like when a wizard summons a golem).            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]**    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has armor 1            
        - Plus 1 point for each point invested in STR            
    - Usage:        
        - Reduces the damage that the city receives.            
        - (If the city has negative armor, the attacking enemy reserves victories equal to the negative value).

#### Enhancement

A city gains additional attributes through enhancements. A city can improve its attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]), skills, talents, specializations, and combat statistics ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|armor]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|attack]]). Points ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health\|health]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Speed\|speed]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth\|wealth]]) can be improved either by enhancing the city's attributes or by enhancing specializations. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] can also be increased through trade.

Each skill and attribute is enhanced according to training rules. For example, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] can only be improved using the skill raw strength. However, an exception applies to cities: cities can enhance one skill using another skill if it can be logically justified. For example, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] can be improved using the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]] if research was conducted in the city to improve the muscle mass of the inhabitants. In such cases, the threshold required to gain 1 point in a skill or attribute is doubled, or the complexity level needed to gain points is doubled.

A city can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] to accelerate its [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|training]]. Each 1 point of wealth adds 1 training point.

#### Items

With the help of items, a city can improve its skills, talents, and specializations, even beyond their maximum level. Items cannot enhance [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] or city attributes. An item can be bought from another city or the black market (controlled by the storyteller) and placed in the inventory.

>[!example]
> - Field Hospital: talent healer (healing) +2
> - Cannon: attack +3
> - Mobile Generator: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] +1

A city can also "create" items according to the rules of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Items\|item creation]]. The only exception is that a city can use 1 wealth point to gain 1 point for creation (ordinary characters cannot).

Regarding the inventory, each item has its weight (as mentioned above). When the inventory is full (i.e., the city has run out of speed points), the city can no longer place any additional items in the inventory. If a city wants to get rid of its items, it must sell them to another city or destroy them without compensation (which costs 1 slow action). Materials that help in the creation of items (such as steel, oil, gas) are considered a special bundle. This means that one type of material can be placed in the inventory as a bundle that can hold 10 pieces of that material (if the city has several types of materials, they must be placed in separate bundles). Special materials add 1 point to the item creation.

#### City Actions

In a game with civilizations, all activities are considered combat or conflict. Therefore, the game is played according to combat rules. From previous chapters, we know that combat has three phases: declaration of action, execution of action, and result of action. Everything written in that chapter applies, but there are some exceptions.

During the declaration of action, a player selects one city or one army. The order in which cities or armies are selected is determined by the speed points of the civilization (or by rolling dice each round). The order in which city actions are declared is determined by the speed points of the city, not the entire civilization. In battles with armies, the order is determined by the attack value of the army. The fastest army is the one with the lowest attack.

Another exception is that each city can perform only one action per round (each action a city performs is considered a slow action).

Lastly, the result of the action (i.e., dice roll) can mean either damage, reduction of other points (e.g., skills), or creation of an item. It always depends on what is rolled. It doesn't always have to be damage. Cities cannot use the victory level rule for regular characters (cities can damage another city or army, but not disarm them).

##### List of Actions

In the game, an action is considered any activity that ends with a dice roll. This means that activities like negotiation, trading, and overall diplomacy (when cities talk to each other) are not considered actions.

Each city can perform only one action per round. A city can focus on enhancement (according to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|training rules]]), item creation, item destruction, attacking an enemy army, or repairing damage.

>[!note] 
> - If an army attacks a city and that city has already performed another action, it cannot defend against the army.
> - However, a city can defend itself if another city within the civilization has already performed an action.
> - If multiple armies attack a city, the rules for fighting multiple enemies apply (the city rolls its combat roll only once, and each army rolls its roll once. Then the city's roll result is compared to the rolls of all attacking armies).

Each army can perform two actions per round: one movement and one attack (or use of one spell). A round ends for an army whenever it attacks. If the army does not perform any movement, it reserves 1 victory in the attack.

##### Attack, Army, and Armor

The storyteller can decide whether cities will attack each other directly (one city rolls a combat roll and the other city rolls a combat roll). Or they can decide that cities will attack each other with the help of an army that must reach the enemy city to attack it (and may encounter another army on the way).

If the storyteller decides on the first scenario, the city's attack is calculated as _3 + points in all attributes + weapon_ (which the city has in its inventory) and _armor 1_. The player must determine what type of weapon and armor it is, or they can use the elemental system from the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Monsters from Pocket#Elementy\|magical monsters]].

In the second scenario, the city must create an army. The army is then considered a separate entity as if a wizard summoned a golem, and the creation of the army follows the same rules as when the city creates an item (and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item price rule\|price rule]] is the same). However, the army has several exceptions. Its attributes are Attack and Armor (and the type of attack and type of armor). The attack also represents health points (i.e., an army with an attack of 2 will have health 2. When damaged, the army's health and attack points decrease). Regarding speed points, an army with a lower attack is considered faster. Lastly, the army cannot hide in its own (or any other) city; it must be outside the city (where it can be repaired by the city, like an item).

##### Diplomacy or Trade

Cities can communicate with each other, express their wants or needs, or even engage in trade. Cities can trade in resources (where one city sells several points of steel to another), manufactured items (where one city sells a generator to another), or services (where one city helps another with repairs or directly with manufacturing or training). Trading itself does not count as an action (this mainly applies to trading resources and products). Trading only counts as an action when it involves services (where one city “produces” several training points for another).

Prices for goods and services are not fixed. It is recommended to use the item price rules, but each city can adjust the price according to its needs.

As for diplomacy, in addition to talking to each other, cities can force others to do something. This involves [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat#Social Combat\|RPG - Combat#Social Combat]] (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active conflict]]). Alternatively, civilizations can agree to create a large parliament where each civilization has one vote (or where they roll dice against each other for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|SOC]] skills).

#### Map

The storyteller does not have to use a drawn map with a specific number of squares (but if they want to, they can). They can use the distance rule during combat or the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Traveling\|traveling]] rule (where the complexity level derived from the distance converts into the number of rounds the army must overcome to reach its goal).

The terrain is the most important part of the map. Some squares may add dice to the army (or city) or may subtract dice. If the storyteller does not use a drawn map, they can use a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|luck dice]] or a table of randomness.

>[!example]
> 1. Lose 2 dice for all rolls
> 2. Lose 1 die for all rolls
> 3. No dice loss
> 4. No dice loss
> 5. Gain 1 die for all rolls
> 6. Gain 2 dice for all rolls

#### Dice of Chance

When the narrator wants to make their game more interesting or is unsure what to do, they can use a random events table. These can provide answers to questions like:

- What is the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Weather\|weather]] like where the characters are?    
- Who did the characters [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter\|meet]] while traveling through the forest?    
- What magic is the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random conflict\|enemy using]]?    
- And many more

To determine a random event, regular dice (D6) are used, where the number on the dice or dice indicates a specific option in the table. All events or options are organized into groups, with the number of options depending on the number of possibilities. The narrator rolls the dice separately. The first die determines the group (i.e., the column in the table), while the second die determines the item in that group (i.e., the cell in the table).

>[!example] 
A roll of 4 and 2 in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|disadvantage]] table means "Emotional."

The narrator can use:

- The first die to determine the table (e.g., even number and odd number)    
- The second die to determine the column in the table (e.g., column 3)   
- The third die to determine the item (e.g., item 4 in that column)

#### Enemy Attribute Points

During forest or country travel, characters might be attacked by bandits. To save the narrator from worrying about enemy statistics, they can use this list, which categorizes enemies by complexity (tier). The tier determines the number of attribute points the enemy gets. If the narrator can't decide, they can roll a die (in this case, the tier equals the result minus 1).
  
1. 0 points in attributes or skills and no combat talent. The enemy has no weapon.    
2. 1 point in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 1-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
3. 2 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 2-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
4. 3 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 3-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
5. 4 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 4-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
6. 5 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 5-point weapon or armor (or combination).

>[!example]
> - T0 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 0 = 3 dice for attack, armor, or weapon 0 - e.g., cat
> - T1: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 = 4 dice for attack, armor, or weapon 1 - e.g., zombie
> - T2: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2 = 5 dice for attack, armor, or weapon 2 - e.g., bandit

### Random Weather

Characters were walking through the forest when suddenly it started raining... ? The weather that the characters encounter is determined by the storyteller. They can roll the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Dice of Chance\|chance die]] and choose from the offered options. Or, if they prefer, they can just use it as inspiration.
#### Weather Table

|     |      1 - 2       |      3 - 4       |      5 - 6       |
| :-: | :--------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: |

|  5  |   Party Cloudy   | Pleasant Weather |      Storm       |
|  6  |     Very Hot     |   Strong Wind    | Natural Disaster |

##### Weather Severity

When the storyteller determines the weather, they can roll dice to see how much the weather affects the characters.

1. Huge impact. The weather worsens the characters' situation significantly. By 150%.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather increases by 4)        
2. Great impact. The weather worsens the characters' situation considerably. By 100%.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather increases by 3)        
3. Greater impact. The weather worsens the characters' situation more. By 50%.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather increases by 2)        
4. Slight impact. The weather worsens the characters' situation slightly. By 25%.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather increases by 1)        
5. No impact. The weather does not worsen the characters' situation at all.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather does not change)        
6. Better impact. The weather slightly improves the characters' situation.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather decreases by 1)

### Random World

The narrator might find themselves needing to quickly create a new world or at least its dimension. If they're unsure about how exactly the world should function or look, they can use the following rules and tables.

#### Three Story Dice

If the narrator has so-called "story dice," they can use those to build the world. Simply roll 1 to 3 dice for each category (in the list below).

- Dice for the world (what it is, how it looks)    
- Dice for advantages (friends, good things, helpful elements, friendly animals, plants, objects)    
- Dice for disadvantages (enemies, harmful elements, poisonous things)

**The narrator can also roll the dice to determine what the characters need to do to succeed:**

1. Activate a mechanism, repair it, or just find it and understand it
2. Move, push, throw something, or use physical force
3. Attack the enemy, avoid the enemy, or deceive the enemy
4. Think, solve a puzzle, or learn something
5. Overcome fear, break their principles, break the law
6. Swim, cut down a tree, climb a mountain

**The narrator can also decide which element will be present in the given world:**

1. Fire, something hot, in a volcano
2. Water, something cold, underwater
3. Earth, something solid or crystal-related, underground
4. Air, something pressurized (like air pressure), in the sky
5. Electricity, something related to technology, possibly forgotten technology
6. Plants, something related to life, within an organism

**Or, if the narrator doesn't want to choose between elements, they can decide which color of magic will be used in the given world:**

1. Brown = rot, fungi, mold, disease
2. Gray = elements
3. Green = plants
4. Red = organics, body transformation
5. Blue = spirits, soul, psyche
6. White = energy, physical phenomena

**And if the narrator decides to use magic, they can also determine the level of that magic:**

1. Primitive = like the Stone Age
2. Common = at the level we have in our world
3. Exceptional = at the level of our world, but scientists are still working on it
4. Rare = at the level of futurism stories in the not-so-distant future
5. Very rare = at the level of Sci-Fi stories, but something that can still be physically explained
6. Legendary = like fairy tales

**Lastly, the narrator can roll the dice to determine where the characters will start their story in the new world:**

1. By a river, sea, or lake
2. In the mountains, on cliffs, somewhere high
3. In a city, village, or settlement
4. On a road between cities
5. In a meadow, field, or somewhere outside of civilization
6. Deep in a forest or jungle

### Random conflict

The narrator might find themselves needing to quickly create a conflict in their story. They can follow the suggestions below or choose from the following tables using the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Dice of Chance\|Dice of chance]].

#### World / Republic / Story

Roll a die to determine what stands against each other in the conflict:

1. [[Elements\|Elements]] (e.g., fire against water)    
2. [[Color of Magic\|Color of Magic]] (e.g., plants against decay)    
3. Size (e.g., dwarves against giants, or man against corporation)    
4. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]] against technology or fairy tales against knowledge    
5. Time (past against future)    
6. Mixed conflict (e.g., small plants against large technology)

#### Type of Conflict or Obstacle

When the narrator doesn't know what obstacle the characters face or what the conflict entails, and how the characters can resolve it:

1. Mechanism - activate, repair, find, destroy    
2. Manual work - push, pull, move, throw, use force    
3. Enemy - fight the enemy, deceive them, reveal them, intimidate them    
4. Thinking - solve a puzzle, find information, learn something    
5. Overcoming - their fear, their principles, laws    
6. Environment - remove a tree, fill a ravine, climb a mountain, swim across a river

#### Main Mission or Task

The narrator can use the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Dice of Chance\|dice of chance]] to make a choice. They need to roll three dice. The first die determines the group (table), the second die determines the column, and the third die determines the item.

**When the first die shows an even number**

|   |           1           |            2           |            3            |             4             |            5            |              6              |

#### Group No. 1 (When the Die Rolls 1 or 2)

##### Column - 1 - 

###### Item 1 - Underworld

In this world, there is an underworld where beings go when they die. The way a being dies is reflected in its appearance – for example, it may wander around with a severed head. Beings can escape from this underworld or find employment there or do other work. If a being leaves the underworld without being employed (meaning it didn't find a job there), it is stuck in the place where it died, for example, it cannot leave a house – it simply cannot. However, it can return to the underworld. The being is always a ghost – an ugly creature that controls unique magic based on its state and can decide whether to help or harm others.

###### Item 2 - Diary

In this world, there exists a diary. When someone writes a name, manner, and time into it – the being will die exactly as written. This diary is managed by the spirit of death, who is bored and thus created the diary. The spirit enjoys playing with people and the diary owners.

Another variant of the diary could be a diary of fate, where the being can change the fate of others (for example, turn someone's victory into a loss). Or it could be a diary of sins, where the being sees all the sins of all beings (especially the one it is looking at). Or this diary could be a list of demons – where the being finds a demon of interest and the demon fulfills its wish, of course, for a price.

###### Item 3 - Dreams

In this world, there exists technology that allows one to enter another being's dream. This technology is used either as a therapeutic tool for a psychologist or as a tool for stealing ideas. When someone enters the dream world, they are at the mercy of the logic of the dream, which is determined by the dreamer (for example, gravity might work strangely there, they might breathe underwater, or the dream might completely change the characters – turning them into fireflies). The one who entered the dream must avoid changing and must maintain their own shape at all times. They must, of course, not die. They can wake up on their own, at any time (and even if the dreamer wakes up, no one dies).

###### Item 4 - 10-year-old from Home

Craftsmen, wizards, scientists, or a certain type of beings have a rule in this world. When they reach the age of 10, they must leave their home for 20 years. During their journey around the world, they must improve in their craft (and of course, they must survive, find work, etc.).

###### Item 5 - Aliens

In this world, there are aliens who crashed there by sheer accident. These aliens were taken by the government for study to learn as much as possible about them and use their technology. More aliens may come, or they may not. The discovery of the aliens can be kept secret, or it may not.

###### Item 6 - Music and Emotions

In this world, magic (or technology) is powered by music and emotions. That is the main magical force (or electricity). Alternatively, the whole world functions on some kind of music (and emotions changes effect of the music ).

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 1 - Sunken

A catastrophe occurred and in this world, most of the land is permanently submerged (or affected by another element). The beings have already adapted to the new life and continue as best as they can (basically rebuilding the same society - of course with limitations). Now treasure hunters venture into the ruins of the old world to dig out treasures from the past era (or take whatever they find useful).

###### Item 2 - Strange Laws

The world has strange laws, whether they be physical, chemical, or other natural laws. For example, a person might be able to walk on the ceiling. From white walls, bird chirping might be heard (the wall is, of course, solid). The environment might contain small cubes that can be manipulated (e.g., collected and stacked using some tool to create a uniform surface). The laws of this world have their own logic, but compared to our world, they are completely strange.

###### Item 3 - Castle

In the clouds of this world, there is a flying castle (or some fortress), which is abandoned and no one has ever been there. It might be a remnant of an old civilization, or a new civilization might have arrived. This castle hides a power that can change the whole world. Whether for better or worse, depends on who finds the castle.

###### Item 4 - Angels and Demons

In this world, there exist religious beings - angels and demons, who fight against each other. The beings of this world use them for their own purposes.

###### Item 5 - Monsters

Monsters (such as vampires) live in this world, and they have their own way of life. These monsters may have built a society. How they influence the beings of this world depends on the author. But monsters always have to affect the inhabitants in some way.

###### Item 6 - Sport

In this world, there is one sport that is incredibly popular, to the point that the entire world revolves around it - parliament passes laws for this sport, beings learn it in schools and universities, and even industries create things for this sport (e.g., unreal tournament).

##### Column - 3 -

###### Item 1 - PC World

Beings can transfer themselves into a computer world with the help of a machine that digitizes them. In the computer world, the same rules apply to them as to programs.

###### Item 2 - Mega City

In this world, there is one large and mega-dense city that looks like a cube from the outside, but inside it's a mish-mash of roads, buildings, and other things a city needs. And the city has both old buildings (ancient shrines) and new buildings.

###### Item 3 - Exists

In this world, there are stories that are read to children or series that are broadcast on TV. But one story that is broadcast, even though it is fiction, actually exists; it's just that no one knows.

###### Item 4 - Gods

In this world, gods exist. These gods interfere with the lives of beings according to what the gods represent. For example, the goddess of love manipulates love, creating love triangles. The gods in this world can communicate directly with the beings they choose and can grant these beings unique magic (other beings don't have this magic, only blessed beings do).

###### Item 5 - From Dimension

The world was invaded by beings from another dimension who can jump between dimensions and stop time. So the beings from the invaded dimension started to defend themselves and at the same time began to look for an artifact that would stop the invaders. However, the artifact is located in other dimensions, so these defending beings decided to jump to other dimensions of the multiverse.

These beings (who are defending) exist only thanks to quantum computers that remember their existence. And if these computers don't remember something, it ceases to exist. Therefore, during a jump, they might lose an arm.

These beings must be connected to their world (or base) with a cable (the cable travels with them and looks more like an antenna). If they lose the cable, they will be forever trapped in the other dimension or disappear. 

###### Item 6 - Fungus

A catastrophe occurred in the world that caused a toxic fungus to spread across the world, killing everything it touches and transforming all nature and animals beyond recognition. This fungus creates a toxic jungle that can only be survived by animals and plants that have mutated there. (When someone kills an animal, it starts to rot, and the jungle spreads).

##### Column - 4 -

###### Item 1 - Broken

This world is broken, like a cup. There are shards of the old world and places of nothingness (as if there were black holes). The world is literally broken - for example, a building might be split in half. Information can also be broken, the world might be missing a part of its magic (which it must have had), or beings don't have names, or they have only certain animals.

###### Item 2 - Labyrinth

The whole world is one big labyrinth with many dead ends. This can be literal, meaning the cities are designed this way, or it can be metaphorical, where the rules and social structure are so incredibly complex that they are like a labyrinth.

###### Item 3 - Court

In this world, there is one large court that decides on important matters. At this court, almost anything can be filed, and its decision is binding for everyone (and everyone respects it).

###### Item 4 - Flame

In this world, one can be infected by a demonic flame. It's a fire that can infect any being, just by touching the flame (or an infected being). The infected being burns, and the fire gradually spreads until it completely engulfs the being. And then, this being desires only to destroy all living things until it finally dies in terrible pain. A person can be freed from the fire only by another god or they must cleanse themselves somehow.

###### Item 5 - Necronomicon

In this world, there exists an evil that can be summoned by a book (someone just needs to read the activation spell). This evil is murderous and wants to destroy the world. The book contains several spells that can cause harm, destruction, and summon the dead.

###### Item 6 - Heroes

In this world, there are heroes who have their unique spells, which they use in battles against other factions.

In this world, three factions fight, influenced by three main forces:
- Red: Strength    
- Blue: Mind    
- Green: Agility (each hero has different levels of these forces)    

Heroes improve their abilities with items and by combining them into stronger artifacts.

##### Column - 5 -

###### Item 1 - Bosses

This world is divided by powerful bosses. Each one has a different personality, a different style of ruling, different abilities, and a different worldview. One, for example, could be a banker who sees everything through the lens of money. Another could be a scientist conducting experiments.

Each of them demands absolute obedience (for different reasons, e.g., one for survival, another behaves like a mobster). Each of these bosses owns a part of the world adapted to their profession (e.g., the scientist's area looks like a lab). The bosses hate each other. Whether they can tolerate each other depends on circumstances and whether they need each other. Otherwise, they are in constant war.

###### Item 2 - War

In this world, a massive war is taking place, and everything (industry, schools, art) is subordinated to this war.

###### Item 3 - Superhero Factory

In this world, superheroes can be created. It is a difficult and long process during which many people die, but in the end, someone with superpowers emerges. The purpose of these heroes is determined by the storyteller.

###### Item 4 - Drug

In this world, there exists a drug—something that a person needs, which gives them great advantages, but it also destroys them, turning them into a monster, and they can't live without it. This drug is rare—hard to find, and often someone has to be killed to get it.

###### Item 5 - Nightmare

In this world, there exists endless and indestructible evil that can materialize fear, i.e., what a being is afraid of. This evil transforms every dream into a nightmare, where it wants to imprison the being forever. However, there are warriors who fight against this nightmare by jumping into the unfortunate person's dream and freeing them. They find the exit or defeat a demon (created by the being's fear, e.g., a giant spider).

###### Item 6 - Transmutation

In this world, there exists magical alchemy that can combine multiple elements (or objects) into one. Matter first turns into energy, and it merges. This fusion is difficult, so the being must learn it well. In alchemy, the law of equivalent exchange applies, meaning the cost of fusing an object must be balanced by raw materials (and energy or the life of the character). They use magical diagrams for alchemy, where they place raw materials and start the reaction with their magical energy. Alchemists can only create what they have knowledge and raw materials for (e.g., a granite sword from a granite floor). Some of them serve the army, others are terrorists, or scientists studying alchemical fusion.

##### Column - 6 -

###### Item 1 - Asteroids

In space, there are asteroids that host various living (and non-living) biomes. They are enormous, seeming like they were ripped from a planet. They have cores made of liquid lava, flowing water, other elements, metal, sand, etc. Humans decided to teleport a few workers there to cultivate the asteroids and create a livable environment. These workers now have to struggle through hardships, fight with fauna, flora, lack of food, water, air—everything—because they must survive and prepare the asteroid for colonization.

###### Item 2 - God of Good and God of Evil

The gods of good and evil decided to end their battle by organizing games, in which chosen contestants fight for their side (good or evil).

###### Item 3 - Blood Magic

Magic or technology in this world is powered by blood. For example, when a character wants to create a fireball, they must use their own blood for it. (Modifications are up to the author, spells can look bloody or not).

###### Item 4 - Multi-Weather

In this world, there are multiple climate zones in one place. For example, one city might have winter with snow, another, a kilometer away, might have a desert, and a third might be a jungle.

###### Item 5 - Inverted World

The world is broken into floating islands that orbit the sun. The problem is that the sun is "down" and gravity pulls "down" as well. Thus, the illuminated parts of the islands are on the bottom, while the upper parts are dark with eternal night.

Living on the bright sides is extremely difficult because gravity pulls objects towards the sun, not the island. And the bottom part of the island has no floor or ground to catch a being.

Living on the dark sides is also difficult because of eternal darkness, but the island catches objects (so gravity works as expected in our world).

###### Item 6 - Mechanical Fortress

A mechanical castle roams the world. It has legs like a spider and doors that allow teleportation to any other door. The owner of this castle is involved in various societal changes and is sought after for their endless possibilities.

#### Group No. 2 (when a 3 or 4 is rolled)

##### Column - 1 -

###### Item 1 - Organization

In this world, there is a secret organization that either protects people from a hidden threat or consists of villains who want to achieve something secretly.

###### Item 2 - Isolated

The place is isolated from the world (planets, worlds). The characters crashed there on some vessel and can only leave with that vessel. They cannot call for help or request reinforcements—they only have each other and what is on the vessel.

###### Item 3 - Action Reaction

In this world, every action (activity, thought) has a reaction that works in the opposite direction. What kind of reaction depends on the world's setting. If it’s a dystopia, then it might be negative, or it could be determined by rolling dice.

###### Item 4 - Underground

In this world, there exist underground tunnels and catacombs built by monsters. These monsters are led by a demigod who communicates with the underground through a large heart. In this underground, the monsters have everything they need—food, entertainment, gold, and weapons. They emerge from the underground to terrorize the surroundings.

###### Item 5 - Transformation

When someone enters this world, they begin to change physically and mentally. For example, a being might enter a world of cats and gradually transform into a cat.

###### Item 6 - Young Gangs

In this world, there is a poor district that is the center of violence. Here, children learn to survive. Eventually, they join armed gangs that use them to transport drugs (or other criminal activities) and for bloody battles. (This could also be a district under the influence of a religious cult or the army).

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 1 - Guardian of Technology

In this world, advanced technologies are widely used, but they have their own intelligence and sometimes go crazy. Policemen or specially trained guardians come to tame this technology.

###### Item 2 - One Decides

In the world, there are several miraculous characters, but none is as powerful as one character who can change the universe with a single thought. After all, she created everything here, even the miraculous beings, without knowing it. This one powerful character rewrites the entire universe whenever she gets bored. To prevent her from accidentally destroying the entire universe, the miraculous characters must entertain her. Of course, they must not tell her anything.

###### Item 3 - Autopilot

In this world, there are cars (or other vehicles) that are intelligent and can drive without a driver. Therefore, no one learns to drive (since there’s no need).

###### Item 4 - Blessed

In this world, there are gods or demons who, for a price or service, grant beings magic or technology that others can only dream of. However, not everyone is worthy of the blessing. Both gods and demons choose (each according to their taste and rules). Some gods and demons fight against each other, others entertain themselves and play with people's lives, and some build something (e.g., their own utopia).

###### Item 5 - Incarnation

In this world, there are a few beings who have perfect memory of all their past (or future) lives. This memory activates at a certain age (e.g., 15) or is unlocked through a ritual. These beings know everything they did in all their past lives (or future lives), what happened to them, and how they died. Some use this knowledge for good, others for evil.

###### Item 6 - Religious

In the world, there is faith, religion, and priests. God exists (communicating either with people or priests), and priests can perform the magic of the god (or his miracles), and all rituals work precisely (for example, a ritual that is meant to cleanse a soul literally cleanses the soul). In this world, all problems are solved through faith and god.

##### Column - 3 -

###### Item 1 - Trick

In this world, magic does not exist. Everything is just a trick achieved through physical laws, mirrors, light, and fog. Each trick depends on the magician's skill and the audience's gullibility.

###### Item 2 - Fairy Tale

In this world, things happen as in classic fairy tales. They might have similar (or the same) stories, plots, characters, and conflicts. For example, like Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf.

###### Item 3 - Combat Cooking

In this world, when chefs want to cook something, they must first hunt and kill it. Therefore, chefs are also hunters of various monsters, whose meat (or plant matter) is highly prized, but it spoils quickly and cannot be preserved (only cooked).

Chefs can also compete in their craft.

###### Item 4 - Races

In this world, conflicts are resolved through races or sports that the whole world plays. For example, instead of war, a game of Tetris takes place. These races are bloody (for example, with Tetris - players are on a large field, and stone blocks fall on them that they must arrange). The results of the races are binding for everyone.

###### Item 5 - Mafia Rules

In this world, the mafia is the main government, ruling almost like a normal state. Of course, in a mafia style, because mafia crime is legal. Fighting for the old law (i.e., laws that prohibit crime like in our world, I hope) is illegal for the mafia.

###### Item 6 - Our World

The world in which the story takes place is similar to ours, but with some changes.

##### Column - 4 -

###### Item 1 - Video Games

The story takes place in the world of video games, where everything works according to the logic of video games. Whatever is in the program applies.

###### Item 2 - Hunter

The beings of this world are being hunted by someone. Either a higher being comes to hunt the inhabitants of this world for fun or for another reason.

###### Item 3 - Yin and Yang

In this world, the line between good and evil is thin. Every evil thing contains something good (a maniacal ruler protects the country and there is no hunger, but he kills people because they are different or disagree with him), and in every good thing, there is something evil (saving a person who then causes someone else's death just by existing, for example, because they are radioactive).

The decisions of the beings are also not purely good or evil—they might be better in some ways and worse in others.

Do I kill a creature that has poisoned the nearby area?

If yes, loggers will have a place to cut wood, and the village will prosper, but I will kill an intelligent and unique being.

If I don’t kill the creature? The village will starve because the loggers won’t have a place to cut wood, or it won’t sustain everyone.

###### Item 4 - Reassembled

This world was destroyed, as if broken into cubes. As characters move through the world, it reconstructs itself under their feet. As if the cubes fly from nothingness under their feet to create land, buildings, etc. And when the beings leave that place, the cubes return to nothingness.

###### Item 5 - Many Times

In this world, there are places where times converge. The past, present, and future coexist there simultaneously.

###### Item 6 - Invincible

In this world, there exists an invincible hero (or enemy) who can defeat anyone, destroy anything, and kill everything.

##### Column - 5 -

###### Item 1 - Remote

The given place is as remote as if it were on another planet—extremely far from home (or another main civilization). The home planet sent people to this very remote place to colonize it, and they succeeded.

###### pol. 2 - Mahou shoujo

In this world, girls (or boys) can make a contract to have one wish granted—but then they must fight against giant demons. These magical warriors do not have their souls connected to their bodies, but to a stone (which they wear as jewelry). They use this stone to transform from a normal state to a magical state (where they have access to all their unique spells and weapons).

###### Item 3 - Dual

There are two versions of the world with similar histories. They are dimensions that started the same but developed completely differently. For example, one side won World War in one, while the other side won in the other. In one world, the main character (or someone significant) is a hero, and in the other, a villain. Some beings can travel between these dual dimensions.

###### Item 4 - Simulation

The entire world is just a simulation, a massive software/hardware system to which all beings are connected, living their own lives within it. The surrounding world is entirely different, and the reasons for the simulation also vary. However, the beings have no idea.

The problem with the simulation is that due to limited memory, it can only simulate for half a year before the server needs to restart (which resets time). During this process, all beings' memories are erased. At least, that's how it's supposed to work.

Or, the entire world was destroyed by aliens. However, the aliens need the beings (for some reason), so they created a replica of the world (or part of it) on their alien planet. The entire replica is controlled by aliens—who can even modify and change it at night.

###### Item 5 - Bus

In this world, everything is extremely far apart, and all roads lead through dangerous places. Therefore, some beings earn their living by transporting goods and others to various locations.

###### Item 6 - Enhancement

In this world, a being can install something—a device—into themselves that improves them. They might get a robotic arm, a chip, or even a parasite that gives them magical abilities.

##### Column - 6 -

###### Item 1 - Underworld Evil (Pessimistic)

In this story, there exists a second world - the underworld - where people go after death. This world has its own rules (like our normal one), but it is pessimistically inclined, similar to hell. People suffer there, even if they were good during their lives. Demons drag spirits into this second world, delighting in their suffering. Souls in the second world are immortal and suffer forever. Sometimes they are released into the normal world as ghosts to do some task, but once the task is completed, the demons take them back and continue torturing them.

###### Item 2 - Mega Hero

In this world, there exists a mega hero who can solve even the most difficult cases. He is a walking army in one man, seemingly immortal and indestructible. However, he has a small army of helpers who work, fight, think, and clean for him, though he receives all the glory.

###### Item 3 - Phobia

What a being fears materializes in the most terrifying form.

###### Item 4 - Nature Advances

The world (or part of it) was destroyed by a catastrophe. The beings from these places disappeared, either died or fled. Nature returned to these places, struggling to survive there. Trees, grass grow again, and animals have arrived. It looks like a forest, but buildings from the past and many dangers (such as poison or radioactivity) still remain.

###### Item 5 - Animals and Humans

In this world, there are multiple races. Not only human, but also animal races that have their own societies, languages, economies, etc. They cooperate, trade, but can also fight with humans and other animal species.

###### Item 6 - Slaves

In this world, slavery exists, where one group of inhabitants is enslaved and forced to do hard labor for free. The inhabitants are enslaved for some reason—maybe because of how they were born (like in the movie Planet of the Apes), or because the wealthy beings own water, and the enslaved must earn it. Or it could be because some are intelligent, while others are uneducated (e.g., they can't operate complex machines or use magic).

#### Group No. 3 (when a 5 or 6 is rolled)

##### Column - 1 -

###### Item 1 - Secret Club

In this world, there is a secret club where members fight each other or use monsters to fight against each other and so on. This bloody sport is not done because the members hate each other but to stave off boredom or earn money. This club has its own rules, the members know each other, and maybe they have some rituals. However, they exist in strict secrecy.

###### Item 2 - Alternative

In this world, there exists an alternative to, for example, medicine, newspapers, or magic—these alternatives are widespread, people believe in them, and use them in their daily lives. The problem is that these alternatives are promoted by charlatans, they harm, and can even kill beings. But the beings do not believe this; they only believe in the alternative things and claim that the main (traditional) thing is harmful.

###### Item 3 - Guardian of Action

In this world, there is magic that guards a certain action. For example, a goddess of commerce who protects every transaction, and if someone lies or deceives a trader during a transaction, they receive a terrible punishment.

###### Item 4 - One Person

In this world, there lives one person who has experienced everything—for example, they fought in the First World War and the Second. They saw the cities being built. This person remembers everything and cannot be killed.

###### Item 5 - Submarines

In this world, travel is conducted by submarines that can dive into water, earth, lava (depending on the story). Without them, people cannot travel, trade, or transport goods. People live in enclosed complexes (because around them there is water or another element through which the submarines travel).

###### Item 6 - Contract

In this world, there exists a mysterious contract that beings can make with immortal demons. This deal is risky and has its consequences.

A being can choose one wish that the demon must fulfill. However, in exchange for this advantage, the being must bind themselves to the demon. Their souls merge, and the demon slowly begins to drain the being's life, who will die much sooner.

The demon gains a physical form, allowing them to live in the world among humans. They can transform into their demonic form, which is invincible, but during this transformation, the demon will drain the being much faster.

The nature of the relationship depends on the type of contract. The being and the demon can fight together against someone else. Or the being can become the demon's slave, carrying out its orders.

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 1 - Dark Lord

In this world, a cruel dark lord once ruled, who was defeated and sent to the underworld by a hero. However, his servants are trying to bring him back at any cost.

###### Item 2 - Control

In this world, there are beings who can control the elements that make up the entire world. Either through dance, martial arts, or other movements. They can control these elements but not create them—the element must be nearby.

###### Item 3 - Revival of the Monster

In a secret location, an experiment was conducted to revive a long-extinct monster or species of monsters (like dinosaurs). However, the experiment got out of control, and everyone who could, fled. Now the monsters are doing whatever they want.

###### Item 4 - Caste

In this world, people are divided into castes or groups. For example, they are divided by occupation (miners, engineers...), by role (guards, workers, scholars), or by whether they can use magic or not. Children born to parents in a certain caste must work in the same job as their parents.

###### Item 5 - Seers

In this world, there are seers who can see the future. The further into the future, the more hazy it is. So they see the near future much more clearly. Special offices use seers to prevent crimes (or for other purposes).

###### Item 6 - Twins

Every being has a twin born somewhere else. These twins have a slight awareness of each other—knowing if the other is alive or in danger. Various rules can apply to twins; for example, if one dies, the other turns into a demon. Or twins must always choose the same profession, otherwise, they will not succeed. Or twins must stay far apart, or they will die.

##### Column - 3 -

###### Item 1 - Great Empire

In this world, there is a great empire that spans several continents. Despite this, the empire strives to conquer and enslave more and more new territories.

###### Item 2 - Time Travel

In this world, time travel is possible. One can go to the past to fix something in the present or go to the future to see how their decisions will change the entire planet. Time travel can be achieved with the help of a time machine, which requires specific fuel and high speed.

###### Item 3 - Morphs

In this world, there are "morphs". These are creatures that infect the living (or dead) and turn them into monsters. These monsters then kill others. From the completely destroyed bodies, a substance emerges that spreads like an infection, modifying the destroyed bodies into weapons or organs that do something else. It's all part of a large organism that just consumes.

Morphs can be of any element or origin. They can be fungi, plants, sweets, or metal.

###### Item 4 - Colony

Beings came to this world for a single purpose: to colonize it. They only have basic survival items, essentially no roads, just some tents, and they struggle to survive. They must live mainly off nature, which provides everything but not for free.

###### Item 5 - Plant Demons

In this world, there are demons that use thick, creeping plants to achieve their goals. These plants are unnatural—they embody horror itself. Besides having eyes, they kill people. These monsters can only be destroyed by destroying their core (such as a crystal heart).

###### Item 6 - You Won't Age Here

In the world, there is a place where no one ages. When a being comes to this place, their biological time stops.

##### Column - 4 -

###### Item 1 - Virus

An unknown deadly virus has almost wiped out all beings. The survivors moved underground because it is the only safe place. They only go to the surface when they need something.

###### Item 2 - Only Discoveries

In this world, most problems have been solved, so the beings set out on a great journey through space (or worlds) to find new planets, elements, civilizations, and form alliances. Civilizations that are not ready for this are only observed by the beings, waiting for them to evolve. Yes, even in this world there are wars, but only between stubborn civilizations or those that want to assimilate everything for themselves.

###### Item 3 - Immortal

The main hero or a selected group of beings never dies, no matter what happens to them. The heroes indulge in horror-related things (studying monsters, pathology), are surrounded by creepy things, and overall do not fit into the given world. Everyone would like to exclude them from society, but they cannot because this selected group is useful, albeit eccentric.

###### Item 4 - Mafia

In this world, there is organized crime that is run like a business (selling weapons, drugs, using prostitution and gambling). The mafia is divided into families, each with its own boss who manages everything. These mafia families can be at war with each other or at peace, but each has its own visual style and way of ruling (e.g., Chinese mafia looks and behaves differently from Italian mafia).

###### Item 5 - Different World

This world has a completely different shape. It can be flat, like a cube, or like a cylinder. This world can be fragmented (islands floating in the air) or hollow (like our planet being hollow) and so on.

###### Item 6 - Boring Work

This world is full of routine and boredom. Everything is the same, everything works the same, and nothing deviates from the schedule. Even the work is monotonous and boring.

##### Column - 5 -

###### Item 1 - Forgotten

In this world, there exists magic, technology, craft, or place that has been forgotten how it works. Beings have gotten used to just using whatever is magical, and it somehow works. They don't know anything more about it and don't bother with it.

###### Item 2 - Fragments

In this world, there are certain fragments that, with the help of the last fragment, will unite and defeat a great evil.

###### Item 3 - Organism

The entire world is one big organism, with inhabitants serving as workers (like erythrocytes in a body). The organism can be organic or mechanical, and every part of the organism works solely for its survival.

###### Item 4 - Mask

In this world, there exists a magical mask that gives the wearer incredible strength. The mask brings out all the buried and suppressed qualities of the being. An extremely introverted being who loves comics becomes a superhero operating according to comic book logic.

###### Item 5 - School

Children attend a large school where they learn everything necessary about the world, history, and mathematics. Whether it’s a magical school, a military school, a school for video games, or technology, the storyteller decides.

###### Item 6 - Airships

Beings do not live on the surface of the earth but in airships or flying fortresses.

##### Column - 6 -

###### Item 1 - Underworld Good

In this story, there exists a second world to which people go after death. This world has its own rules (like our normal world), but it is optimistically inclined, similar to heaven. Evil people are in prison in this world.

###### Item 2 - Gladiators

In this world, there is a bloody gladiatorial sport where beings fight to the death. They might fight animals or have to go through some obstacle course.

###### Item 3 - Parasite and Medicine

In this world, there exists a very necessary medicine. However, this medicine is obtained by inserting a terrible parasite into a being, which drains their life and mentally destroys them.

###### Item 4 - Mega Corporations

Mega corporations have divided the entire world. Governments or states do exist, but they essentially have no power or are subordinate to the corporations. These corporations own a lot of land and beings, whom they can command. They exploit, manufacture—without regard for the planet. Corporations own the police, the army, and healthcare—everything.

###### Item 5 - Split World

The world has split into two mirror parts. One is in complete contrast to the other (if it is light in one, it will be dark in the other).

###### Item 6 - Riddle

The world is falling into ruin (or has a big problem), and the only thing that can save it is solving a riddle. It could be a text, a mathematical formula, or a treasure map. At the end is the solution to all the problems.

### Story cubes

When the narrator is unsure how to continue their story, what should happen next, or what the characters found, they can use so-called story dice. These are words that the narrator can use as needed. Simply roll the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Dice of Chance\|dice of chance]] and choose from the available options.
