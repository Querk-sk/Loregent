### What is an RPG? 

RPG (Role Playing Game) is a social game where the narrator tells a story, and players react to that story as fictional characters. The story the narrator tells can be entirely made up or taken from a book, game, or movie. Players decide what their character will do and then roll dice to determine the outcome.

A player plays as their fictional character, just like actors in movies. The player thinks like the character, talks like the character, and does everything in the story that the character would do. So, if a player is playing as an alcoholic character, they will drink a lot of alcohol in the game, even though they may be a teetotaler in real life.

The narrator, on the other hand, creates the story, ensures the RPG rules are followed, and creates obstacles for the players to overcome in the story. Importantly, in our RPG system, there is no single "one true story" that everyone must follow. There's not even a prescribed genre or type. So the story can be whatever the narrator comes up with. Whether it's sci-fi, fantasy, a zombie apocalypse, an epic journey in the style of The Lord of the Rings, or even a single tavern brawl, the narrator has complete freedom in creating the story.

> [!example]
>As for the rules, the Narrator should listen to their players. This isn't a competition about who survives—it's a "story generator." The Narrator can agree with the players on some modifications, even if they go against the rules of our RPG system, because it is all about agreement and a good story. However, it is necessary to state that the Narrator always has the final word in everything.

#### In short - how it's played

At the beginning of the game, the Narrator tells what will be played and in which world. Then they explain the rules of that world and what it looks like. Based on this, the players create their characters. The Narrator describes the first scene, and the players start saying what their characters will do.

> [!example]
>A post-apocalyptic world that is largely flooded (small buildings are not visible at all, large ones only partially). People live in tall skyscrapers. They have boats, catch fish, grow seaweed, and cultivate remaining crops on rooftops. A player can be a treasure hunter, a fisherman, a member of the skyscraper community, or even a human-fish hybrid who is better off underwater.

In the story, a situation may arise that the players need to respond to, or the players themselves may want to perform an action. In that case, they ask the narrator which skill they should use (or they choose one themselves and ask if they can). The narrator determines the difficulty level of the action. The player rolls dice, with the number of dice rolled being calculated based on the character's attributes and statistics. The number of successes rolled on the dice determines how the story will continue.

> [!example] Príklad z hrania
> Narrator 
>>You opened the dungeon door, and as you walked down the corridor, you suddenly saw the shadow of a person on the floor. 
>
> Player 
>>Are there any pillars I can hide behind? 
>
>Narrator 
>>Yes, there are pillars along the wall. 
>
>Player 
>>I will hide behind a pillar, in the shadows, so no one can see me. 
>
>Narrator 
>>Roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, difficulty level 2.

The player checks the character sheet to know how many dice they can use for the roll. In this case, it will be 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] + the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill. If the player rolls two or more successes, they successfully hide. Otherwise, they either fail to hide in time or knock into an unlit lamp, causing noise.

>[!note]
>3 dice are added to each roll

#### A note on player-to-player communication with the narrator

Our system is flexible. The Narrator can adjust the rules as needed. Therefore, not all things or possibilities for how the rules should be applied are mentioned here (for example, what damage a sword should deal on a hit, what talents a player is allowed, and so on). This is determined solely by the Narrator and their story. On the other hand, every player can fully use their creativity to create the character they want. Of course, considering the rules set by the Narrator.

> [!example]
>Even if it is a medieval story, the character can be a 'Truck Driver' if it involves a random time traveler or a reincarnated soul (who was a truck driver in their past life).

But everything must ultimately be approved by the Narrator. Therefore, it is necessary for the player to come to an agreement with the Narrator. Not only at the beginning of the game, but also during it. If a player feels they should receive a bonus to their roll, for instance, if they are shooting a bow from a higher position, they can suggest it to the Narrator. The Narrator will then decide whether to grant the player a bonus or not. If the Narrator cannot decide, they can roll dice (if there are multiple options) or flip a coin.

#### The most important rules

- **First most important rule**: Our RPG system is modular. This means that the Narrator can choose which rules to use in their game and which not to. Some rules can be completely ignored, or they can be replaced with ones that fit better.    
- **Second most important rule**: An RPG game is about a good story, good fun, and an overall great experience.

### Game chronology

Just as every story has a beginning, middle, and end, so does an RPG game. The narrator determines the beginning, middle, and end. The story does not have to start at the beginning; it can start in the middle—for example, when the characters are running from an enraged dragon.

Time in an RPG story flows similarly to a short story or book. It does not have to progress hour by hour or turn by turn. The pace of the story is set by the narrator. The narrator may decide to skip a few weeks or months. Such jumps are made, for example, when the characters are traveling somewhere or during boring passages like a lecture at university. During such a jump, players state what their characters will be doing. If it involves completing something (e.g., an item, training, healing), they roll the appropriate skill for that activity. The number of rolls and the level of difficulty are determined by the narrator.

> [!example]
> The players are traveling on a spaceship. They are attacked by another spaceship. At that point, time moves slowly—turn by turn, with the players deciding what they will do during each turn. Let's say they successfully finish the battle, and the captain decides to head for repairs to a distant spaceport. The journey will take them a month. The narrator asks the players what they will be doing during that month of travel.
> 
> One might engage in research. Another might upgrade their armor. Another might exercise. For these activities, the players roll the appropriate dice to see if they succeeded (how many times they can roll the dice is determined by the narrator).
> 
> The narrator briefly describes what happens during that month on the ship—based on the dice rolls of the players. If necessary, the narrator can create a small scene where the players can talk to another character or get scolded by the boss for messing something up. After summarizing the month-long journey, the narrator tells them they have arrived. And time "slows down" again.

#### Start of the Game

At the beginning of the game, the Narrator introduces their story, which they may have created or based on a movie or video game. They explain what it's about, what genre it is, and might add a short scene or a historical story. The Narrator then describes the rules of the world (is there gravity?), how things work in everyday life (do they travel by balloon? do they only eat vegetables?), in what time the story takes place (medieval times? future?) and what style the story has (steampunk? candyland?). The Narrator also informs the players about the situation affecting the story they are going to play (did the king die and now everyone is fighting for the throne?) and what the players will probably be doing there (main mission? do they have a goal? do they need to eliminate someone?).

At the beginning of the game, players create their characters. They should follow the rules of the world created by the Narrator. However, these characters do not have to fit perfectly into the story or be "custom-made"—for example, if it’s a war, not everyone has to be a professional soldier; they can be ordinary people.

Once the players and the Narrator agree on the characters, the game can begin.

##### Don't know how to create a Story?

If the narrator can't create a story, they can think about a main theme. Something around which the whole story revolves or which might emerge from the story. Then, characters or groups of characters can be created around this theme, with some for it, some against it, and some taking a neutral stance, possibly trying to use it to gain something.

> [!example]
> Cloning, what do the characters say about it, what moral questions could the story address?

If the narrator can't create a world, they can just set some features that will help or hinder the players. If the narrator has "Story Cubes," they can roll them and choose based on the picture that comes up. This way, they can decide on the laws of the world (e.g., gravitational, economic) or even the main theme.

Additionally, the narrator can treat the world as a character with some statistics and talents or spells. Some attributes will have a certain appearance (for example, a world with high STR might be angular, while a world with high REF might be very fast). And the world can either hinder the players (playing against them) or help them (e.g., there's someone else causing trouble, and the world wants to remove them).

Or the narrator can use our tables from the additional chapter. For example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random World\|Random World]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random conflict\|Random Conflict]] alebo [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random World Rules\|Random Rules for the World]].

#### Middle of the Game

The game flows like a story. During it, the narrator tells their story, and the players respond through their characters. They act as if they were actors in a film—which means that if a character has a hot temper, they might "explode" in certain situations, even if it doesn't fit or the player knows it will worsen the situation.

During the game, the narrator gives the players (their characters) tasks and places obstacles in their path that slow down or stop their progress through the story. The players (their characters) respond to these obstacles and try to do something about them by using their skills and talents. To determine if the character succeeded in what they wanted to do, they roll dice. Based on the results, the narrator decides how the story will continue.

#### End of the Game

The game ends when the narrator says so, when the narrator agrees with the players, when the story ends, when the characters complete their mission, or when the characters die or fail their mission.

At the end of each game, there should be a brief summary of everything that happened after the story. It might be helpful to roll for luck to see how the characters will fare going forward. Ending the game, session, or story does not mean the characters' lives end. They, along with their world, can be used in future games. It should be seen as a continuing story. Just as there is Terminator 1, there is also Terminator 2 (the author has no knowledge of any other Terminator movie).

### Traveling

In every story, characters travel from one place to another. To make this traveling not boring, our RPG system does not use realistic traveling (where the exact distance characters travel is measured), but rather narrative traveling, where the distance is determined by the number of events or problems that the characters experience or need to solve.

#### Distance

Travel distance falls into three categories:

- Close    
- Farther    
- Very Far    

The storyteller does not need to think much about how many kilometers the characters need to travel. It is enough to decide between the three options (listed above). However, if the storyteller wants to determine the distance exactly, they can use the following list as a reference.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/01-challenge-level/rpg-other-challenge-levels/#zoznam-vzdialenosti" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




### Other Challenge Levels

In this section, there are lists of challenge levels for variables such as distance, height, depth, weight, time, and so on. These lists serve as a guide for the Narrator when they want to determine the challenge level of a journey (when characters are traveling somewhere), the challenge level of a spell (for instance, when a character wants to lift a car with their magic), or the challenge level when characters encounter some danger and need to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|solve the situation quickly]].

#### Narrative distance between two places

This challenge level is used when characters are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Traveling\|traveling]] somewhere, and the Narrator wants to determine how long they will travel or how many events they will experience along the way. It can also be used when they are in a hurry (for instance, when the villain wants to activate a superweapon, and the characters want to stop them) to see if they can make it in time, or when a character is sneaking past guards to see if they go unnoticed.

The narrative distance increases the base challenge level of the character, changes the challenge level for the enemy, or changes the number of rounds during which the enemy can roll dice (for example, the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill when searching for the character).

Below is a list written in kilometers, but it can also be used for other distance units. So, for example, when determining a spaceship jump, it won't be calculated in kilometers but in light-years. And when a character floats in a space station and pushes off with their legs (to travel a distance, for example, from the bridge to the laboratory), it will be calculated in meters, not kilometers.

As for skills, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] is used to overcome distances (if the character is on foot), or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (if they are driving a car), but other skills can also be used as determined by the Narrator (for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] when jumping in a space station or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] when swimming across a river).

##### List of distances

1. Distance 0,5 Km || (15 minutes )
2. Distance 1 Km ||  (30 minutes)
3. Distance 5 Km ||  (1 hours)
4. Distance 10 Km ||  (2 hours)
5. Distance 50 Km || (10 hours)
6. Distance 100 Km || (20 hours)
7. Distance 500 Km || (4 days)
8. Distance 1 000 Km || (8 days)
9. Distance 5 000 Km || (1,5 months)
10. Distance 10 000 Km || (~3 months)
11. Distance 20 000 Km ||  (~6 months)

>[!note]
>- The time written for distances is the time it takes for a person to cover that distance. According to the internet, the walking speed of a person is approximately 5 km per hour.

##### Distance, car and shoes

Objects or machines that accelerate or somehow facilitate movement, reduce the challenge level when covering distances. The exact amount by which they reduce the challenge is determined by the Narrator, as each machine has different movement capabilities.

>[!example]
>
> * Magic Boots of Speed ​​= (minus) 1 ZL
> * Bicycle = (minus) 2 ZL
> * Car = (minus) 3 ZL
> * Single-seat plane = (minus) 6 ZL

The challenge of covering distances is also influenced by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Size of the character\|size of the character]]

##### Distance, terrain, and circumstances

When it comes to distance (whether narrative or combat), the success of overcoming it is influenced by circumstances such as terrain complexity, gravity strength, or thin air.

>[!example] 
>- A strong snowstorm can add a CL +2.
>- A high mountain can add a CL +4

Movement circumstances (whether terrain or weather, and so on) can be applied at any time and as needed. Sometimes the circumstance is so strong that before the main roll, the character must also make a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|skill check]] of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill. For instance, when they are in deep water or flying in low gravity.

##### Change in Movement Speed

The final challenge level (derived from distance) can also change based on how fast the character is moving. For example, when a character is rushing to overtake someone (say, in a race), or when they are slowly sneaking through a garden to avoid guards.

Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Slower movement has the advantage of the character moving much more quietly, but on the other hand, it takes longer. The advantage is that the character's challenge level decreases (for example, when walking through dry leaves), while the disadvantage is that the guards will roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] multiple times in a row. This time disadvantage, however, breaks the rules. Because on one hand, it decreases the challenge level derived from the distance, which on the other hand "kind of" speeds up the character's movement through the terrain - since the challenge level also indicates how quickly the character moves through a given section (for example, at challenge 4 it is about 2 hours, or 4 rounds of rolling dice). So what should the Narrator do?

Well, when a character moves slower, the challenge level decreases when solving problems (i.e., when rolling skills). However, the time is extended. If a character, for example, reduces the challenge by 2 (by moving slowly), their time is extended by 2. So, for a distance of 3, they will have challenges with CL 1, but it will extend their time to 5 ( 10 hours, or 5 rounds of rolling dice ).

* Slowly
	- Description:
		- The character moves slowly, carefully, or quietly.        
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 2 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 2.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance increases by +2.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +2 extra dice rolls.

- Slower    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves slower, more carefully, or more quietly.
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 1 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 1 success, or the CL for the enemy increases by 1.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance increases by +1.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +1 extra dice roll.

- Normal    
	- No changes

- Faster    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves a bit faster, more recklessly, or noisier.
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 1 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 1 success, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 1.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance decreases by 1.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 1 fewer dice roll.

- Even faster    
	- Description:    
	    - The character moves even faster, more recklessly, or noisier.     
	- Advantage:    
	    - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 2 for the character.        
	    - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 2.        
	- Disadvantage:    
	    - The time needed to cover the distance decreases by 2.        
	    - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 2 fewer dice rolls.

>[!example]
The character is sneaking down a corridor with guards. However, they are in a great hurry because the enemy will activate their superweapon in 3 rounds.
>
The character decides to go 'even faster.' Thanks to this, they will overtake the enemy, but on the other hand, the guards may detect the character sooner because, to detect them, they need to overcome a much lower challenge level in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|perception]] rolls.
>
(In this case, it can be that the character rolls [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] and rolls 4 successes. This becomes the challenge level for the guards. They will roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] – but because the character is in a hurry, they only need to overcome CL 2 instead of CL 4.)

#### Narrative Height

Narrative height refers to the height that a character must overcome when jumping somewhere. Narrative height also includes depth when a character is falling from some height. It can also refer to the depth of the sea when a character is swimming in an underwater cave. It can also refer to flight altitude when a character is flying in an airplane. We have summarized all these cases in the following lists, assigning a challenge level to each height (or depth). The lists use challenge levels that have already been adjusted to account for normal human abilities.

However, if a height in the story is not a whole number (e.g., 4.2 m), the number is rounded "up" to determine the challenge level (in the case of 4.2 m, it will be 5 m).

##### Narrative Height

This list of challenges accounts for **jumping up** (when a character jumps somewhere), **jumping down** (when a character jumps into a pit), or even **leaping over** (when a character jumps across a chasm).

1. Height 2 m
2. Height 4 m
3. Height 8 m
4. Height 16 m
5. Height 32 m
6. Height 64 m
7. Height 128 m
8. Height 256 m
9. Height 512 m

##### Narrative Height (flying an airplane)

If a character is flying an airplane (and so on), they need to fly at a certain height above the ground to avoid crashing into a tower or tree. Therefore, the lower they fly (for instance, to avoid radar), the more challenging it will be for them to maneuver without crashing. The list below assumes a character flying a typical light airplane. Therefore, if the character in the story is flying something heavier, the Narrator should adjust this scale accordingly. The heavier the airplane, the higher the challenge at lower altitudes.

1. Height 512 m
2. Height 256 m
3. Height 128 m
4. Height 64 m
5. Height 32 m
6. Height 16 m
7. Height 8 m
8. Height 4 m
9. Height 2 m
10. Height 1 m
11. Height approximately 0 m

##### Narrative Depth

When a character swims in the sea, they swim at a certain depth. The deeper they dive, the more difficult swimming becomes due to increased water pressure and currents that are not present at shallower depths. The scale below reflects this challenge, accounting for a typical character swimming with regular diving equipment. However, if a character is swimming in a submarine (or something that protects them from pressure), like with distances, the machine subtracts some value from the challenge (for example, a personal submarine CL - 8).

1. Depth 2 m
2. Depth 4 m
3. Depth 8 m
4. Depth 16 m
5. Depth 32 m
6. Depth 64 m
7. Depth 128 m
8. Depth 256 m
9. Depth 512 m

#### Narrative Weight

It is used when characters want to lift something or someone, move something, push something. Simply put, they have to exert effort against some weight. Narrative weight has nothing to do with the character's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Inventory\|inventory]] (and the items in it).

Secondly, the challenge of narrative weight is relative. It will be determined differently, for example, in a world full of giants or in an ant world. Therefore, the Narrator must adjust this list (below) according to the story. The lists use challenge levels that have already been adjusted to account for normal human abilities.

0. wt. 5 Kg. (e.g., newborn, vacuum cleaner, watermelon)
1. wt. 10 Kg. (e.g., child, bucket of paint, tire)
2. wt. 20 Kg. (e.g., large bucket of paint, leopard, dumbbells)
3. wt. 40 Kg. (e.g., toilet, washing machine)
4. wt. 80 Kg. (e.g., baby elephant, bags of cement)
5. wt. 160 Kg. (e.g., refrigerator, large piano)
6. wt. 320 Kg. (e.g., deer, compressor, trailer)
7. wt. 640 Kg. (e.g., seven refrigerators, camel)
8. wt. 1 t. (e.g., car, minibus, medium-sized boat)
9. wt. 3 t. (e.g., rhinoceros, small truck, jeep)
10. wt. 5 t. (e.g., tank)
11. wt. 10 t
12. wt. 20 t
13. wt. 41 t
14. wt. 82 t
15. wt. 164 t
16. wt. 328 t
17. wt. 655 t
18. wt. 1 K.t
19. wt. 3 K.t
20. wt. 5 K.t

[Weight of Stuff – We like to weigh stuff so you don't have to](https://weightofstuff.com/)

- ton = 1000 kg
- kilo ton = 1000 t    
- mega ton = 1 million t    
- giga ton = 1 billion t

The challenge level from weight is reduced by objects or machines designed for lifting. The exact reduction must be determined by the Narrator, as each machine has different capabilities. (The list below includes machines or objects that operate in kilograms).

* Magic strength gloves = (minus) 1 CL
* Furniture moving straps = (minus) 2 CL
* Forklift = (minus) 7 CL
* Small crane = (minus) 10 CL

#### Timing of skills

It is used in the story when characters want to lift something and hold it for a certain time (for example, a burning coal, which is part of a courage ritual), or used for spells, for example when a character summons an elemental with a short lifespan.

##### CL, Time, and Speeding Up or Slowing Down

When a character needs to, they can speed up their action (e.g., disarming a bomb when there's no time, so they must hurry). Or when doing something complicated and wanting to concentrate - they can "slow down" their action. It's the same rule as with distances and movement speed, just slightly adjusted. Mainly in that for the required time to perform an action, the challenge list from the time is used (as shown above).

- Slowly    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action slowly, carefully, or quietly.   
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 2 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 2.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action increases by +2 (e.g., instead of 1 hour, it will take 1 day).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +2 extra dice rolls.

- Slower    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action slower, more carefully, or more quietly.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems decreases by 1 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they get 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy increases by 1.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action increases by +1 (e.g., instead of 1 hour, it will take a few hours).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets +1 extra dice roll.

- Normal    
    - No changes

- Faster    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action a bit faster, more recklessly, or noisier.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 1 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 1 success, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 1.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action decreases by 1 (e.g., instead of 1 day, it will take a few hours).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 1 fewer dice roll.

- Even Faster    
    - Description:        
        - The character performs their action even faster, more recklessly, or noisier.            
    - Advantage:        
        - The challenge level for solving problems increases by 2 for the character.            
        - Or when the character rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they lose 2 successes, or the CL for the enemy decreases by 2.            
    - Disadvantage:        
        - The time needed to perform the action decreases by 2 (e.g., instead of 1 day, it will take an hour).            
        - When the enemy rolls against the player, the enemy gets 2 fewer dice rolls.

#### Events

Distance only indicates how many events a character (or their entire group) experiences during travel. The number of events can be determined simply or more complexly. The group completes the entire distance once they experience (or solve) all the events that travel brings.

##### Simple Determination of Number of Events

- Close - 1 event    
- Farther - 2 events    
- Very Far - 3 events

##### Complex Determination of Number of Events

When the storyteller uses the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels#List of distances\|distance list]], the number of events the characters experience on the journey can be determined according to this list. The complexity level based on distance can then be used as a number to determine the complexity of all events during the journey. Alternatively, this number can be used to determine the number of event rolls according to the table of randomness. Everything is explained below.

###### Challenge level of Events

The challenge level (CL) based on distance determines the complexity of all events the characters encounter during the journey. This means that if the CL is 6, then the CL of one event will also be 6. However, the storyteller can divide this number into multiple events, for example, the characters experience 3 events, each with a CL of 2.

###### Number of Events

The CL based on distance determines the total number of events the characters encounter during the journey. This means that if the CL is 6, then the number of event rolls according to the tables of randomness will be 6. So the storyteller rolls the dice 6 times and chooses an event according to the tables. They can choose from the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter#Náhodné stretnutie\|random encounters]], a random task according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random conflict#Náhodný konflikt\|random conflicts]], or from the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Story cubes#Príbehové kocky\|story dice]]. They can also determine the weather according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Weather#Náhodné počasie\|random weather]] or the properties of the terrain according to the table of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random World#Náhodný svet\|random world]].

##### Note on Number of Events

The storyteller does not need to stick strictly to any numbers during journey planning. If they decide that nothing significant happened during the journey, that is fine. Or if they decide that instead of 6 smaller events, there will be one side quest - that is also fine. The storyteller has complete freedom in how many events to include in the journey and how significant they should be.

#### Types of Events

Each event falls into three categories:

- Combat Event    
- Story Event    
- Exploration Event    
- Mixed Events, which combine the previous ones    
- and Rest Event

##### Combat Event

Combat events may or may not be important for the story. Characters can fight against bandits, animals, or even living plants. It's a good opportunity for the storyteller to show what kinds of monsters exist in the world or what types of dangerous groups there are.

Things in combat events are resolved only through combat or some type of duel.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters has attracted the attention of the main villain, who sent some minions to test their strength.
>- The group of characters encounters someone they have taken money from.
>- The group of characters notices marks on the trees. However, they don't know that this territory belongs to monsters who attack the group because they ignored the warning (not noticing the marks).
>- The characters arrive in a village where the main lord is bored. So the lord organizes a race with obstacles (and monsters).

##### Story Event

In story events, roles are played as if in a theater play. Characters can encounter another character who talks to them and tells them something. Characters can get into negotiations with an enemy or attend a celebration.

Things in story events are mainly resolved through dialogue or by solving puzzles, problems, or mysteries.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters encounters a group of wandering musicians who travel the world and play wherever they are paid. They can exchange stories and important advice.
>- The group of characters comes across a golden carriage guarded by strong knights.
>- It seems that the group of characters has entered a territory where the ghosts of the deceased cannot, well, die, and they remain in this world. The same fate could befall the group unless they solve their problem.
>- The characters find a discreet shop where all items are obviously quite expensive and powerful. But when they ask for the price, the shopkeeper says they'll sell it for "a small favor."

##### Exploration Event

Exploration events reveal more about the place or the overall land where the characters are. They are not in any danger from enemies – the characters need to use their eyes and ears (and sometimes their wits).

Things in exploration events are resolved by being observant, walking, finding a path, with the main enemy being the place itself.

>[!example]
>- The group of characters comes to a deep chasm. A rickety bridge leads across it. How will they cross the bridge? Will they go another way?
>- Millennia ago, wizards split the seas to allow people to pass between two islands, but it seems that this ancient magic is fading, and there are random currents of water from the sea walls. How will they cross this path to survive?
>- What seemed like a normal mountain is actually moving. It turns out to be the back of a giant turtle. The entire forest shakes and trembles as this huge beast moves. The characters must flee, but how and where?
>- The group of characters finds an old battlefield where a great battle once took place. What will they find there?
>- The group of characters passes through a field of magical plants that emit hallucinogenic drugs. The characters' nightmares become reality. What must they do to escape?

##### Mixed Events

Sometimes the storyteller may not be able to choose between the offered options and therefore can combine events.

Mixed events are events that blend several categories, either because they can change from one to another, or because they exhibit traits of both categories simultaneously.

>[!example]
>- (Combat and Story): The group of characters came to fight an evil witch who had killed many villagers. The witch says they can make a deal – if they let her go, she will give them an item that will greatly help them on their journey. If they fight, they will lose this item. This event starts as a story and can turn into a combat event, depending on how the parties negotiate.
>- (Exploration and Story): While exploring an abandoned mine, the group meets a small creature that seems lost. The creature is extremely cautious and scared of the group. But over time, they manage to befriend it. Once they are friends, the creature helps them pass through a dark cave. This event starts as exploration, continues as a story, and ends as exploration.
>- (Exploration and Combat): The group must find three items that bind ancient spirits to an abandoned mansion. They must destroy these items while the spirits attack and trouble them. This event is both exploration and combat.
>- (Exploration, Combat, and Story): The main villain has kidnapped an important character and plans to perform a ritual in their fortress. The characters can try to negotiate with the villain, attack directly, or infiltrate the fortress and quietly free their friend. The choice is theirs.

##### Rest Event

Rest events are when characters simply rest at a camp. During this rest, they can eat, heal their wounds, but they can also train their skills, weapon handling, or spells. In addition, they can engage in other activities, such as studying a mysterious book they have.

For longer journeys, it is recommended to give the characters at least one rest (one dice roll – for example, for regeneration or training, etc.)

### What does the character know?

The player controls their character in the story and decides what they will do (according to their personality, past, beliefs, and moral compass). However, the player does not need to know everything that their character knows. In such a case, the narrator tells the player to roll the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] skill, and based on the result, the narrator tells the player what they do not know.

On the other hand, the player's character does not know what the player knows. It is forbidden to use knowledge in the game that the player's character has no idea about and has no way of knowing. No actions should be based on this knowledge.

>[!example] 
The players are in a sci-fi story where there are flying cars. They are fleeing from the police and looking for a good car to steal. The player rolls the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill but completely fails. The narrator tells them that they found a car that looks amazing, like a Lamborghini Diablo among flying cars. However, the player knows it's a trap because they failed their dice roll. But this is the player's knowledge, not the character's. Therefore, the player must act as the character would in this situation and get into the car, even though they know it's a trap.

In the event that players are discussing the story among themselves and trying to come up with a plan or solution to a problem, it is important to remember that it is the players who are talking, not their characters. The characters have no knowledge of this plan or solution. Players need to exchange this information as their characters would, in the same style their characters speak. For example, if they use slang or a particular accent or style of speaking, they should use it.

On the other hand, a player's character may know things that the player has no idea about. For example, if they are playing a fantasy story and the player has a character who reads a lot (such as a scholar). If a monster attacks the group, the player can ask if their character has read anything about the monster and if they know of any weaknesses.

- The narrator EITHER says yes and tells everything the character might know.
- OR the skill is rolled - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] - against the difficulty level determined by the narrator (to see if the character remembers). However, if it's a special monster that only a zoologist might know about and the player does not have the relevant talent, the character rolls at [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].    
- OR expertise is rolled (in case the character actually has the talent for zoology). Then the skill - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] - is rolled in combination with the zoology talent, against the difficulty level determined by the narrator.    
- The result will be information that players can use against the monster (for example, that it is afraid of water).
