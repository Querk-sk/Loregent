### Basics of Magic

This chapter contains basic information about magic, which you can use to create your own magical system. If you are looking for a magical system directly from our universe, you will find it in another book [[MAG - Full Book\|MAG - Full Book]].

>[!warning] 
>The word '[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]]' or the word 'spell' in our RPG system is used as:
>- A spell (fireball)
>- Super abilities (laser eyes) 
>- Sci-fi technologies (hologram, teleport) 
>- Skills of skilled craftsmen (a cook and his spell 'my special pizza') 
>- Traits according to the type of character (a turtle that can spit out a stream of water) 
>- and other similar things.

A character can use magic for combat, defense, or to perform any other activity that comes from the given spell (e.g., a fireball to light a campfire).

Magic and spells work the same way as: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|skills]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|Combat]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|Weapons]]. So if you have read these chapters, you already know almost everything about magic.

#### Who Can Use Spells?

Unless otherwise specified, any character can use magic. However, the narrator can modify this by setting specific restrictions in their magical system.

>[!example] 
> - Magic can only be used by a character with a certain attribute level (e.g., INT 2 and above),
> - or requires a special talent (e.g., fire school 1),
> - or requires a specialization (e.g., ranged fire spells 2),
> - or must have an item to cast spells (e.g., spell crystal),
> -  or an essence (e.g., fire essence),
> - or a weapon with a spell (e.g., fire axe).

If a character without a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|specialization]] (for combat magic) uses magic, they roll with a major [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the character has a talent but no specialization in combat spells from that school, they roll normally (no major disadvantage), but they do not get any dice from the talent.

>[!example]
>The talent "fire school." For the offensive spell fireball, the character gets no dice but rolls normally. (Without the talent, they would have to roll with a major disadvantage.)

##### Talent and Knowledge of Magic

One way the narrator can restrict the use of magic is by tying magical knowledge to a character's talent. This means that a character will only know spells or magical items that have the same level as the number of points the character has invested in their magical talent. So the number of points in the talent indicates the maximum level of magic the character can use (that they remember). If a character wants to use a higher-level spell, they must find it in a book, but cannot use it from memory.

>[!example]
> - 1 point in talent = Level 1
> - 2 points in talent = Level 2
> - 3 points in talent = Level 3
> - 4 points in talent = Level 4

If the narrator's magic system does not use levels, the number of points in the talent indicates the maximum attack strength (or spell effectiveness) the character can use.

>[!example]
> - 1 point in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 2
> - 2 points in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 4
> - 3 points in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 6
> - 4 points in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 8
> - 5 points similarly = the number of points in the talent is multiplied by 2.

If a spell does not require talent, or the character has a minus in talent, the maximum number of dice (or other points) for the spell becomes 1 or Level 0.

#### Talent and Knowledge of Magic

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is used for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spells, specialization for offensive spells and passive spells (which can be passively [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] or passively offensive). Each point in talent adds a die to the roll when the character is solving a problem with a spell (similarly to skills).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] adds dice to the magical combat roll, increases the maximum damage of the spell, and reduces the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|CL]] for passive spells.

#### Magic Effects

Unless otherwise specified, magic is neutral. Offensive spells can harm allies, and healing spells can heal enemies. This is especially true when they are within the spell's effect range or when the character fails their dice roll.

### Spells

A spell is created when magical talent or magical specialization combines with a skill. Spells can be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]], and they can be cast independently (as active spells) or function automatically (as passive spells) when a condition is met.

#### Active and Passive Spells

**Active spells** are those that the character decides to cast. This can be when a situation arises in the story that the character wants to resolve using a spell (similarly to skills), or during combat when the character attacks someone. Active attack spells can have their unique levels of victory but also have a cost that must be paid (more on this topic is written in the section about [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Cost of Magic\|the cost of magic]]).

**Passive spells** function automatically, but only during certain rolls. For example, only during combat, or when the character is swimming, and so on. Passive spells activate when certain numbers are rolled on the dice. For example, if the number 1 is rolled during combat, the character gets +1 frost armor for each number 1 rolled.

#### How are spells cast?

Each spell is cast as follows:

- 3 dice as the base    
- plus dice from basic Attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]])    
- plus dice from magical talent when casting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spells    
- plus dice from magical specialization when casting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]] spells    
- plus dice from skill    
- plus/minus dice for bonuses from items (if the character has any)    
- plus/minus dice for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances\|circumstances]] (if they are present)

#### How are spells created?

The storyteller can create spells as needed and as it fits into their story. Generally, useful spells are created by combining a magical [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] with a skill. Offensive spells are created by combining a magical [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] with a skill. This means that each spell is connected to a skill. All the spells of a character are then written into the character sheet.

>[!example]
>Ice Shield - specialization Ice Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]
>Fire Wall - specialization Fire Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]
>Wind Arrows - specialization Wind Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]
>Jump - specialization Robo Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] (the character has robotic legs)

Which spell can be connected with which skill? Each skill has a list of verbs associated with it (for example, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]] has verbs like: understand, guess, analyze, solve a puzzle). So you just need to look at the list of verbs for each skill and choose the one that fits.

If you can't choose because your verb (the action the spell is supposed to perform) isn't there, you can create a new skill. This new skill is written into the list of talents (or wherever there is space in the character sheet) and assigned a main attribute. This skill can also be used in the game if the storyteller allows, but its main purpose is to create a spell (for example, teleport, which is not a great example because teleport is created with the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]], because sprint includes a jump).

As for the verbs, each element also has its own list of verbs.

##### Purely Combat Spells

For combat spells, the rule remains that they must be linked to a skill. Additionally, they must be connected to a combat skill from which they can choose a verb (allowed action) they need. However, this "combat skill" does not add any dice and does not require the character to use points to purchase this "combat skill." It mainly serves as a reminder of what the spell actually does.

>[!example]
>Spell "Fireball"
> - specialization Fire School
> - plus skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]
> - plus combat skill (explode, burn – see verbs for combat spells below)

</div></div>


##### Limitations

However, there are a few limitations when creating spells. For instance, one skill can only be associated with one talent or specialization. Unless, of course, it is another function of the same spell, such as creating an ice wall and creating an ice bridge – in this case, multiple spells can be associated with one skill. But otherwise, it is not possible.

If the storyteller (or character) needs to create spells in their character sheet that require the same skill, then they must invest 1 skill point (the point used to invest in skills, talents, and specializations when creating a character) into that spell. For such a spell, the character also gets +1 die for that 1 point.

A spell also cannot be associated with multiple skills. Only one. If a spell needs to have multiple skills, then multiple spells must be created, which are cast sequentially like a "chain." In this case, all spells (before the main one) are cast as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

##### Enhancing a Spell

Each spell can be enhanced by investing a point into that spell during character creation, as well as by using magical items, essence, or training.

- An item enhances a spell when the character holds or wears the item. If the item is removed from the character's body or sold, the item no longer enhances the spell. (e.g., glasses: spell "seeing through walls" +2 dice)    
- Essence enhances a spell when the character uses it during casting. However, the essence burns out after the spell is cast.    
- A spell can be permanently enhanced through training or by the character investing points into it. Such a spell is written into the character sheet along with the number of points. And every time the character casts that spell, the dice from the enhancement points are added.
 
#### Are All Spells Weapons?

We classify spells as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]]. However, all spells, regardless of classification, must have some weapon attributes based on what type of weapon they resemble.

- Whether they resemble a melee weapon (like a sword) or a ranged/thrown weapon.    
- Whether they are similar to a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Blunt weapons\|Blunt]] weapon, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Sharp weapons\|Sharp]] weapon, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Piercing weapons\|Piercing]] weapon, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Explosive weapons\|Explosive]] weapon (for explosive weapons, the area of effect must be determined).    
- The size of this weapon and its area of effect, whether it is a touch weapon (like hand guards), a small weapon, a medium weapon, or a large weapon.    
- Whether this weapon uses ammunition and if any special ammunition can be used. (Everything else about classification is written in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapons chapter]].)

Another attribute that weapons have is attack. Therefore, combat spells also have attacks, which determine the maximum damage a character can deal to their enemy during combat. All spells have an attack level of 1 (meaning each combat spell causes at least 1 injury). This level of damage that a spell can cause can be increased by specialization in a particular school of spells, as well as by items and investment in spells.

#### Victory Levels of Spells

Offensive spells can have their own [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|victory levels]] written next to them. For example, a fireball at Victory Level 1 causes burns, but at Victory Level 3, it sets the enemy on fire. Similarly, a spell at a higher victory level can inflict a status on the enemy (such as making them catch fire). In this case, the victory level also becomes the Level of Difficulty, which the enemy must overcome to rid themselves of the status. Healing the status during combat is considered a quick action.

### Cost of Magic

In our RPG system, every magic and every spell has its cost.

The hidden or indirect cost lies in the character's attributes, as every character wanting to use their magic safely must invest points into their magical talent or specialization. Another, slightly less hidden cost is the complexity level of the given spell. Lastly, magic is directly paid for in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]].

If a character does not "pay" the cost of magic, they cannot cast spells at all, or their casting will have serious consequences in case of failure.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]] are necessary for casting spells, and without them, a character cannot cast. Each character has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]], which can be increased by investing points into the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] attribute. In short, the cost of spells can be summarized as follows: every [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spell costs 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]], and every [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]] spell costs 2 points. (More on this topic can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Energy\|relevant section]].)

Points in talents or specialization, mentioned in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Basics of Magic\|basics of magic]] section, increase the number of dice the character can use in their magical roll. This increases the chances of not failing the roll or saving time needed for casting (because if the complexity level is too high, the character may have to roll multiple times. More details can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers#Spell Charging - f\|combat maneuvers]] section.)

There are several options for the complexity level, each of which the narrator can adjust as they see fit.

#### Spell Challenge Level

The Challenge level is the threshold that a character must overcome in their dice roll. If they do not pass the threshold, the spell is not created, or something worse may happen (see the section on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Spellcasting Failure\|spellcasting failure]]). The Challenge level is not fixed—meaning the narrator can choose from several options. They can set the cost based on the level of magic, what the spell can do, set the Challenge level as the cost of an item, or decide not to set a Challenge level but allow the character to buy advantages in the spell with victories. These options can also be combined—it depends on the narrator.

##### Magic Level (first option)

The magic level (tier) is the threshold that determines whether the character knows the magic. If the character has a magical talent at level 1, they cannot perform magic from level 2 (maybe only if they had a book that increased their level, but otherwise not). This does not affect the Challenge level of solving the problem; it remains the same. The magic level threshold only indicates whether the character can use the spell to solve the problem or not.

>[!example]
>Fire Spell - level 2 = Challenge level 2 (or the character needs a talent in fire spells at level 2).

###### Primitive Magic – Level 0 -

**Rarity:** This magic is literally found everywhere and anyone can perform it, as it is as simple as striking a match or breathing.

**Who Knows It:** Everyone, even children, can do it. No one needs to learn it, or maybe just a little. Thus, a character does not need any talent to use it.

**Who Can Do It:** Everyone

**Where to Buy It:** It can be bought everywhere, commonly in stores, even at a newsstand. It can also be found freely on the street.

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires four times the amount of resources or four times the duration to achieve its effect (e.g., 4g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound for 4 days, 4 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can only perform very simple tasks that characters can do "almost with their eyes closed." For example, tying shoelaces, turning on a light, closing a door.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)
- Can use a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 05 - Magic in general#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of strength 1. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|point]].    

**For Example:**

- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). It is the same with magic at level 0.    
- Light: Shines like a candle.    
- Cooling: Cools hands to about 20 degrees.

###### Common – Level 1 -

**Rarity:** It is found in everyday life, at home, with neighbors, but not everyone possesses it - for example, homeless people may not have it.

**Who Knows It:** Adults can do it, but children cannot because they need to learn it. It is like collecting and drying herbs - one must learn which herbs are medicinal and which are poisonous.

**Who Can Do It:** Everyone

**Where to Buy It:** It can be bought in any ordinary store.

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires three times the amount of resources or three times the duration to achieve its effect (e.g., 3g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound for 3 days, 3 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can perform such common tasks that characters can do - for example, heating food like a microwave.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 05 - Magic in general#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of strength 2. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]].

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 1 can heal the wound in 2 days, plus cleanses the wound (like alcohol).    
- Light: Shines like a motorcycle light.    
- Cooling: Cools the entity to about 20 degrees.

###### Uncommon – Level 2 -

**Rarity:** Found in specialized places such as special stores (hardware stores), or in schools or libraries.

**Who Knows It:** Any student who studies this magic or someone who practices it as a hobby (e.g., an amateur electrician) can do it.

**Who Can Do It:** Only ordinary beings, not blessed ones.

**Where to Buy It:** It can be purchased in an unusual store (e.g., a hardware store).

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires double the amount of resources or double the duration to achieve its effect (e.g., 2g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound for 2 days, 2 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can perform tasks that characters usually do but require more effort, or a handyman (e.g., painting an apartment, moving heavy furniture, driving a car).

Unusual magic also includes items like magical crystals or other things we would consider miraculous in our real world and can be bought in those "magic stores" (e.g., healing stones, magical herbs, various amulets).

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 05 - Magic in general#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of total strength 4. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]]. 

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 2 can do it overnight, plus it can heal the wound if it is inflamed (if the wound is more inflamed, the magic needs to be used multiple times).    
- Light: Shines like a street lamp or the light on a large vehicle.    
- Cooling: Cools a room to 0 degrees.

###### Exceptional – Level 3 -

**Rarity:** Found only in specialized places like a doctor's office or an architect's studio.

**Who Knows It:** A good university student or a specialist who has graduated from university (e.g., a doctor, an architect) can perform it.

**Who Can Do It:** Only beings who have learned this magic. Not blessed ones.

**Where to Buy It:** It can only be purchased in specialized shops (e.g., a 3D printer store) or found in specialized locations (e.g., a medical university library).

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires the usual amount of resources or application (e.g., 1g of a resource - as the recipe requires, applying to a wound only once, 1 liter of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can perform tasks that specialists can do. This magic may break one or two natural laws of the given world.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 05 - Magic in general#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of total strength 6. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 6 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]].

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 3 can do it in a few minutes (for a large wound or severe inflammation about 1 hour).    
- Light: Shines like a stadium spotlight. The light spell can be specialized to shine only on the objects the wizard wants to illuminate.    
- Cooling: Cools all rooms in an apartment building to 0 degrees. Cools a room to -20 degrees.

###### Rare – Level 4 -

**Rarity:** Found in highly specialized places (e.g., research institutes that are unique in the district). Or in markets, royal treasuries, museums, ruins, or other inaccessible places. It exists in limited quantities and is known only by true experts.

**Who Knows It:** Only a professional who has been doing it for a long time (something like a kung-fu master) can perform it.

**Who Can Do It:** Only beings who have learned this magic. Not blessed ones.

**Where to Buy It:** In markets where rare items are sold, in museums (when the museum sells items to collectors), or from adventurers who discovered a secret temple.

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires half the amount of resources or application to achieve its effect (e.g., 0.5g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound only once with half the amount of ointment, 0.5 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can do things that characters cannot. This magic can break several natural laws of the given world in a way that makes it impossible.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Either can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 05 - Magic in general#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of total strength 8. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 8 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]].    

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 3 can do it in a few minutes (for a large wound or severe inflammation about 1 hour).    
- Light: Shines like a stadium spotlight. The light spell can be specialized to shine only on the objects the wizard wants to illuminate.    
- Cooling: Cools all rooms in an apartment building to 0 degrees. Cools a room to -20 degrees.

###### Legendary – Unreachable Level, or Level 8 -

**Rarity:** Found in legends, songs, folklore, or village rumors. This magic exists in material form only in one single -legendary- place.

**Who Knows It:** Only a legendary wizard who engages in extremely complex experiments can perform it.

**Where to Buy It:** There is only one legendary place where this magic can be bought.

**What It Can Do:** This magic breaks all the natural laws of the given world and performs things that are hard to imagine. For example, a staff of elements that can create and control any element.

###### Fairy Tale – Unreachable Level, or Level 16 -

**Rarity:** Exists only in fairy tales or in one completely hidden place.

**Who Knows It:** Only the one who discovered it, or a deity, can perform it.

**Where to Buy It:** Nowhere, or it can be bought from a deity for a high price.

**What It Can Do:** It can do things like in fairy tales. For example, a knife that opens doors to other worlds, or a ring that turns everything into sweets (like the legend of Midas).

###### Hidden – Unreachable Level, or Level 32 -

Only a deity can perform it, and they can grant this magic to any being (turning them into a messenger of the gods or a demigod). In the given world and all other worlds, it can perform things that are unimaginable.

###### Unreachable Level, or Level 64 -

This is something even gods cannot do. Only one single being across all universes can perform it. This magic can literally do anything on an infinite scale, including the destruction or creation of an entire world.

##### What a Spell Can Do (second option)

The Challenge level of a spell indicates the complexity of casting the spell. It can be determined by what the spell can accomplish. If a character is solving a problem in the story (e.g., wanting to jump over a fence) and the problem has a Challenge level (e.g., CL 3), the Challenge level of the spell does not add to the Challenge level of the problem. It is just a separate threshold the character must overcome to cast the spell (e.g., a jumping spell might have CL 2). If the character overcomes the Challenge level for casting the spell, the spell is cast, even if they do not pass the Challenge level for solving the problem. The same applies in reverse—if the character passes the CL for solving the problem but not the CL for casting the spell, they automatically fail the roll, even if they passed the CL for solving the problem.

The Challenge level for casting a spell can be determined fairly easily. In the section on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills STR\|skills]], you may notice that each skill has a list of verbs

>[!example]
>The skill "raw strength" includes verbs like (all listed in the respective section):
>
>Throw, Toss, Discard, Drop, Push, Move, Shift, Press

There is also a list of verbs for combat spells.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/z-rpg-variables/variables-mechanics/verbs-for-combat-spells/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




>[!note] .
>- HIT, (Strike, cut, or stab an enemy with a weapon, projectile, or hands), 
>- DEFEND (Hold, Lift, Protect, Endure, Follow, Stand Up, Defend, Endure, Stay) 
>- DESTROY (Explode, Break, Destroy, Crush)

>
>The list may change, or other actions may be added. 
>As for magical elements, they also have their own verbs. However, we write about them in [[MAG - Elements\|another place]].


</div></div>


Each verb from the skill costs 1 Challenge level (the first verb is free). So if a spell pushes someone, it will have CL 0, but if it lifts + crushes, then the spell will have CL 1. For spells where it is clear that another verb must be included (e.g., for the verb "throw away," "lift" must also be part of the spell), the CL does not increase, as the effects of the verbs occur immediately, and the whole action happens in a second (e.g., the wizard immediately lifts the enemy and then immediately throws them away). The CL of the spell increases when each verb of the spell can be performed separately (e.g., lift - keep the enemy lifted for a few seconds and then crush).

The power of the spell also increases its complexity. Each verb can perform a "human-like strength" (e.g., the spell "throw away" can throw an object as heavy and as far as a regular human can). To make the spell stronger, it must have a higher Challenge level.

One way to determine the complexity is to refer to the section [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|Other Challenge Levels]].

>[!example]
>A spell that can throw someone will have:
> - CL 1 for the verb "throw away" (since it is the first verb, it is free)
> - plus 4 CL if the object is heavy, around 80 kg (approximately the weight of a baby elephant)
> - (So the spell will have a total of CL 4)

##### By Points of Wealth (third option)

The narrator can determine the Challenge level based on what the spell should do or add (e.g., add [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] to another character). They can use the rule about [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]. In this case, all spell attributes are listed and converted to a cost according to the list below.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/04-points/rpg-points-of-wealth/#cena-predmetu" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] refer to the amount of money a character carries. The number is determined by the narrator, and unless stated otherwise, every character receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6]]0 wealth points at the beginning of the game. These points can be increased when the character invests in the attribute [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] and can further be increased by selling, stealing, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward\|completing tasks]].

#### How much money should the character receive?

At the beginning of the story, each character receives a certain amount of money. Below is a list of wealth levels. The narrator determines the character's wealth level according to this list.

- Homeless: (0 - 10)
- Low-income: (11 - 20)
- Average income: (21 - 40)
- Good income: (41 - 80)
- Upper class: (81 - 160)
- High class: (161 - 320)
- Wealthier: (321 - 640)
- Rich: (641 - 1,280)
- Very rich: (1,281 - 2,560)
- Extra rich: (2,561 - 5,120)

If the narrator can't decide how much money a character should receive, they can roll dice, for example, when characters meet a wandering merchant. The number rolled on the dice is multiplied by 10 to determine how much money the other character (such as the wandering merchant) has. If it’s a very wealthy character, the narrator can roll multiple dice.

#### Consumption of wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] (p.w.) in our system are considered as money, such as euros, coins, credits. This is because they are spent in the same way as those mentioned euros, coins, credits. So if something costs, for example, 10 p.w. and the character has 30 p.w. in their pockets, after purchasing the item, the character will have only 20 p.w. left.

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

##### For Example

> [!example]
>- Leather armor, which adds 3 points of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor\|armor]] -> price 6
>- Long axe, which increases max damage by 2 -> price 4
>-  Bandage, which adds 3 dice to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Liečenie zranenia\|natural regeneration]] -> price 3
>- Healing potion, which immediately adds 2 health points -> price 8

##### Quality and Price

If the narrator wants, they can adjust the final price according to the quality or rarity. If the item is rare or of higher quality, the price increases. And if the item is damaged, or is something abundant (like sand in the desert), the price decreases.

- Trash - 16 p.w.
- Horrible / Damaged - 8 p.w.
- Bad / Very abundant item - 4 p.w.
- Worse / Abundant item - 2 p.w.
- Normal + 0 p.w. (base for all items)
- Better / Unusual + 2 p.w.
- Quality / Exceptional + 4 p.w.
- Good / Rare + 8 p.w.
- Very rare + 16 p.w.

##### Merchant Markup

The final price can also be increased by the merchant's markup. To determine it, one, two, or three dice are used (depending on how much the merchant wants to earn). The narrator rolls the dice and the value rolled:

- is added up and added to the final price of the item (when the character buys from the merchant),
- or subtracted from the final price (when the character sells something to the merchant).

#### Price in the Story

When a character wants to buy a room in a hotel, sell a car, or buy a beer—how much will they pay? The narrator can decide how to proceed.

##### First Option

The first option is that the price of an item or service is determined by the number of points (dice, or attributes) a character receives. For example, when a character rents a room in a hotel, they do so to rest and thus restore their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. The price will reflect the number of points the character restores. If it is an item that brings some benefit to the character (for example, a nice shirt adds dice to the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] skill), the number of points (or dice) the item brings to the character determines the final price.

##### Second Option

The second option is that the price is determined according to the scale:

- Cheap: 1 - 5
- Common: 5 - 9
- Pricier: 10 - 14
- Expensive: 15 - 19
- and so on

##### Third Option

The third option is that the narrator looks up the price of an item in our real world, divides it by 30, and rounds up. The minimum price of an item is always 1 p.w.

>[!example]
>A new car costs 22,000 €, so the price should be around 733 p.w.

Of course, the same applies as above. If an item or service is rare (or common) in the given world, the narrator can adjust the price of the service (see section [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 05 - Magic in general#Quality and Price\|Quality and Price]]).

#### Earning points of Wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] increase when a character sells something, completes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Body za splnenie príbehovej úlohy\|a task]], receives a reward for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Prvá možnosť Body podľa úrovne nepriateľov\|defeating an enemy]], or performs a job. They receive their money directly from other characters. The money is added just like during consumption. So if a character has 20 p.w. and sells an item for 30, they will have 50 p.w.

#### Negotiating Prices with a Merchant

The price of an item in a shop can be lowered or increased in favor of the character. To do this, any [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used, rolled as an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active conflict]] against any of the merchant's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute. The price with the merchant can also be changed through simple conversation, or the character can solve the merchant's problem.

If a character decides they want to negotiate the price with the merchant, they choose the skill they will use (any from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used) and state how much they want to adjust the price in their favor (e.g., lower the price when buying, or increase the price when selling). For each point the character changes their price, the merchant gets that many wins added to their roll. This number is divided by 2.

> [!example] 
> For example, a character wants to change the price (in their favor) by 
> 
> 1 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 2 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 3 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 4 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 5 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 6 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 
> and so on

> [!example]
> - A character wants to buy an axe that costs 6.
> - The character wants to lower the price by 4 points.
> - The merchant gets 2 wins in their roll.

- When the price negotiation is won by the character, the price is adjusted by the amount they wanted.
- When the price negotiation is won by the merchant, the price is adjusted unfavorably for the character by the number of additional wins the merchant rolled. These wins are then multiplied by 5.

> [!example] (...continuing from the previous example)
> - The character rolled 4 wins
> - The merchant rolled 3 wins + 2 that they received
> - The merchant, therefore, rolled 1 more win than the character
> <br>
> - If the character wanted to buy the item, its price increases by 5 points
> - If the character wanted to sell the item, its price decreases by 5 points

Price negotiation can only be rolled once.

##### By Number of Victories (fourth option)

In this case, the cost of the spell is approached as if the character wants to create or upgrade an item—see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Items\|Points of Items]]. The victories from the roll are considered as money, which the character uses to buy the result for their spell. This can be according to the price listed above, or as determined by the narrator.

>[!example]  
> For example, a summoning spell
> - The number of victories from the magical roll represents the number of points that the player can invest in the stats of an elemental, golem, etc.
> 	- 1 victory point for 1 attribute point of the golem
> 		- HP (1 HP is free)
> 		- Attack (1 attack is free)
> 	- How many rounds it will exist (1 round is free)
> 		- 2 victory points for 1 attribute point of the golem
> 		- Armor (golem has no armor for free)
> - The summoned golem obeys only the player who summoned it. It does what it is told (it has some basic intelligence but no free will or soul)

### Spellcasting Failure

If a character fails the Challenge level, the narrator can decide that instead of the character casting "nothing," the spell will be weaker, something unintended happens, or the spell benefits the enemy.

If a character fails the magic roll so drastically that they roll half as many victories as needed, or roll no victories at all, a catastrophe occurs.
