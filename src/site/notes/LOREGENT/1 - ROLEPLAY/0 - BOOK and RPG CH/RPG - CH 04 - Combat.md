### Combat

Combat is a conflict between two characters, where one character attacks the other with a weapon to defeat them. The result of combat is the reduction of the enemy's or character's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health points]], or the infliction of a condition, such as stunning. In combat, all attributes, specializations, and possibly also the skills of both characters are taken into account. So, the outcome of combat is determined by a combination of the characters' physical abilities and their knowledge of combat.

Combat can be fought with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Chrániče na ruky\|hands]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Zbrane na blízko\|melee weapons]] (e.g., swords), [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Zbrane na diaľku a na hádzanie\|ranged weapons]] (e.g., pistols), [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Basics of Magic\|spells]], or combat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuvers]] (e.g., a character runs and knocks the enemy to the ground).

#### Combat Rounds

Combat is divided into rounds. In each round, the players (and the narrator) state what they want their characters to do. Once everyone agrees on a certain action, dice are rolled to determine who wins that round. The dice decide everything, but the narrator provides the final outcome. When the action of every character involved in the combat is completed, the round ends, and the next round begins.

However, actions are not limited to just fighting or moving (or fleeing). A character can do anything that a normal person could accomplish in a few seconds. Overturning a table, throwing a stone at the enemy's head, or drawing a weapon. Simply shouting to another character is not considered an action. For details on what a character can do during combat, refer to the chapter on “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|Combat Maneuvers]]”.

Each combat round is divided into steps: Declaration of Action, Execution of Action, and Result of Action.

##### Step 1 - Declaration of Action

Each character can perform one action in a round, or more, depending on the chosen [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]]. All characters' actions occur simultaneously during combat, even though they are announced sequentially by the narrator or players. However, the declaration of action has its order, which is determined by speed points.

- The character with the fewest speed points speaks first about what they would like to do.    
- Then the character with more points goes next.    
- And then the next character with more points speaks,    
- and so on,    
- until the character with the most speed points announces last what they would like to do.

This order is important because faster characters react to what slower characters do.

>[!example]
> - A knight is fighting against a bandit and has fewer [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed points]] than the bandit.
> - Let's say they are fighting in a tavern, and to make it easier for the knight to attack, he wants to jump onto a table.
> - The bandit (who has more speed points) decides to kick the table to knock the knight off.
> - The knight cannot change his decision because he is slower than the bandit.

For simplicity, it is good for characters to attack each other one-on-one. However, in some combats, this is not possible, and multiple characters may fight simultaneously. The number of opponents a character can defend against is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Podľa veľkosti zbrane\|type of weapon]] and the number of points in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]].

>[!example]
> If a character has a weapon - hand protectors, they can fight against 1 enemy +1 for each point in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]].

##### Step 2 - Execution of Action

Once everyone has stated what they plan to do during the round, dice rolls can proceed. A standard combat roll is performed as follows:

- 3 dice as a base    
- plus dice for each point in all Attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]])    
- plus dice for each point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] for the weapon (if the character has it in hand)    
- plus dice from skills (if using a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]])    
- plus/minus dice for circumstances

>[!example]
> The Black Knight challenges the Green Knight to a duel. The Black Knight's attack is calculated as:
>
>* 3 Dice as a base
>* plus 2 from Attributes ( [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 0 , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] 0 , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] 1 )
>* plus 2 from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] in medium swords (as he is attacking with such a sword)
> * Resulting in 7 dice for the attack.

Combat rolls are also performed in order, but from the fastest character to the slowest. The character with the most speed points executes their action first. Only the dice determine whether they succeed or fail.

> [!example] Continuation of the bandit example
> The bandit will roll the dice first, and the knight second. The narrator decides that the bandit cannot use the weapon bonus or their combat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] for the attack roll because they are attempting to kick the table.
>
>If the bandit fails - the table remains stable, and the knight gains an advantage.
>If the bandit succeeds - they kick the table, causing it to become unstable.
>Then the narrator instructs the knight to roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] against a challenge level depending on the number of victories the bandit achieved.
>
>The knight rolls the dice.
>If the knight succeeds - they stay on the table and gain an advantage.
>If the knight fails - they fall off the table and will be at a disadvantage.

Regarding the combat roll and assistance, combat rolls cannot be assisted, and victories cannot be transferred. Therefore, if one character tries to help another, they can only do so by fighting together, with two characters attacking the enemy instead of one.

##### Step 3 - Result of Action

The winner of the combat round is the character who rolled the most victories. Their number of victories is subtracted from the number of victories of the character who lost the combat roll, and the remainder is converted into what is called a victory level. Based on the achieved level, the winner of the combat round can cause an injury to their opponent, disarm them, or perform other actions (see the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|victory levels]]).

In general, there are two categories of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|victory levels]]: offensive and pacifist.

**Offensive** levels are those that cause injury to the victim (reduction of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health points]]), bodily damage (e.g., severing a hand), or permanent reduction of an attribute or skill (something similar to severing a hand).

Regarding injury, it is important to know what kind of attack the character's weapon has, as the attack's strength determines how much damage the enemy takes. A character can achieve a higher victory level, but if they have a weak weapon, the enemy's damage will be lower. The amount of damage is also influenced by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization#Weapon Specialization\|weapon specialization]].

> [!example]
> The character rolled their attack and achieved 4 victories.
> If the character has a weapon with an attack of 1, they will cause 1 damage to the enemy.
> If the character has a weapon with an attack of 3, they will cause 3 damage to the enemy.

**Pacifist** victory level options do not harm the enemy but only reduce the dice during combat or cause the enemy to be knocked out (KO) – meaning they drop out of the fight.

In case of a **tied combat roll** – where both characters roll the same number of victories, the attack is deflected and no one wins the combat roll.

In the case where one character fights **against multiple enemies** and that one character wins (or loses) – the number of victories from their combat roll is compared to the number of victories of each individual enemy separately. It may happen that they win against one enemy while losing against another.

However, the third step (the result of action) does not have to be the last in the combat round. Characters have other ways to gain additional victories in their combat roll. They can use another maneuver or sacrifice some of their points. More on this topic can be found in the chapters [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|Actions during Combat]].

#### Social Combat

This is a different form of regular combat, where characters do not fight with weapons but with arguments. The result of such combat is convincing the opponent under difficult circumstances - for example, when a detective tries to convict a perpetrator, a lawyer talks to a witness, or a diplomat resolves an international dispute. Social combat can be used in various situations. Compared to normal combat, there are several differences.

- In social combat, skills from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute are used (the number of dice is therefore not counted from all attributes as in regular combat).    
- The order in “social combat” is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute.    
- Arguments, facts, and evidence add dice to the roll.    
    - Evidence is something the character can hold or show - for example, a photo from the crime scene or the victim's diary.        
    - Fact - is a “tool” the character creates. This is done by rolling an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|assist roll]] of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]” against CL 3. The character recalls some information. However, if it is a common fact, the character can also use a book or an encyclopedia excerpt as evidence.        
    - Argument - is a “tool” the character creates. This is done by rolling an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|assist roll]] of an applicable [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] skill against CL 3 (or, if the narrator allows, another skill in combination with a talent - but only logically applicable).        
    - The strength of the fact and argument is determined by the number of victories rolled in the assist roll.        
    - For evidence, a scale can be used - 1 weak, 5 strong.        
- The opponent can use their victory level to “destroy” the evidence, argument, or fact, or to "destroy" the opponent.    
- Instead of health points, "social points" are used in social combat, which function exactly like health points, except that when they run out, the opponent convinces the character (or otherwise forces them to change their opinion).

### Distance

Distance is a combat circumstance that determines when characters can attack each other and with which weapon. Distance is assessed according to a scale that the narrator can adjust to their needs. This scale can be used not only in sword fights but also in battles with spaceships.

#### Categories of Distance

##### Close Combat

- Characters are close to each other like boxers or in MMA.    
- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would stand on the same square, right next to each other.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 0 - 1 m.

##### Normal Distance

- Characters are close enough that their swords touch, but they are further apart than boxers.    
- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would stand on the same square, but each piece would be further apart - on the line that borders the square.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 2 m - 3 m.

##### Within Reach

- Characters are a bit further apart, but if they have a long sword in their hands and extend their arm, they will touch the opponent's long sword.    
- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, each piece would stand on its own (adjacent) square.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 4 m - 5 m.

##### Further

- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would be separated by two empty squares up to 20 squares.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 10 m - 100 m.

##### Even Further

- If the fight were to take place on a chessboard, the pieces would be separated by 40 to 100 squares.    
- In reality, this could be approximately 200 m - 500 m.

##### Far

- In reality, this could be approximately 600 m - 1 km.

#### Starting Position

>[!example]
> All sizes, squares, distances, and scales can be adjusted by the narrator according to their needs. They can decide that one square equals 5 m, or 1 km. Alternatively, when using a map, they can decide that 5 cm equals 5 meters.

The so-called “Normal Distance” is the starting position for every combat. Thus, 99% of combats in all games start at this distance. To move to a more advantageous position, characters must win a combat roll.

If a player wants the combat to start (for them) in an advantageous position, they must attack when the opponent is unaware of the combat. They can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] to approach unnoticed, or they can use, for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] - where the character rushes at the enemy. As for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Zbrane na diaľku a na hádzanie\|ranged weapons]], they can start the combat from their current position.

>[!info] 
>The maximum walking speed is 6 km/h or 2 m/s. If a character walks slower, it can be 1 m/s or even 0.5 m/s.

Distance and movement speed are also influenced by the size of the character. More on this is written in the chapter [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Size of the character\|Character Size]].

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/05-combat/rpg-weapons/#weapons" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



### Weapons

Weapons are tools used primarily for attacking or defending against enemies. They can also be used for performing some [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] activities, such as cutting salami, chopping down a tree, or carving a wooden statue. Every [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] use of a weapon must be approved by the narrator.

#### Weapon Attributes

The main attribute of every weapon is attack. Attack increases the limit of maximum damage that the character can inflict on their enemy during combat. Weapons can have an attack at least at level 1 (meaning every weapon, including bare hands, causes at least 1 injury). This level of damage that a weapon can inflict can also be increased with specialization for that weapon.

> [!example]
> The character rolled their attack roll and achieved 4 wins.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 1, they will deal 1 damage to the enemy.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 3, they will deal 3 damage to the enemy.

If the weapon's attack (the limit of maximum damage) is higher than the number of dice the character can use for their attack roll, the character receives bonus dice for their roll. The number of bonus dice is equal to the difference between the weapon's attack and the character's attack.

> [!example]
> The character can use 6 dice for the attack (3 base + 2 from attributes + 1 specialization).
> The character owns a sword with attack 8.
> The sword's attack exceeds the character's attack by 2 (because 8 - 6 = 2).
> The character gets +2 dice for their attack roll.

Regarding the secondary use of the weapon for performing a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] activity, the number of attack points is converted into dice, which increases the number of dice when a skill is rolled. If the secondary use of the weapon leads to damaging the enemy, the attack points are not converted into dice and remain as the level of maximum damage.

The weapon can also have additional attributes or magical abilities. However, for the purpose of calculating the price (wealth points), these will be considered as an attack. As for weight (whether the weight of the weapon increases the attribute or not), the narrator can decide at their discretion.

The attributes of the weapon can help the character not only by adding dice or points to skills and the like but also by improving other properties of the weapon, such as reloading speed. However, these attributes increase the final price of the item while reducing the speed points.

Weapons can also have negative attributes that harm the character or somehow worsen the use of the weapon. Such attributes reduce the overall price of the item. As for speed points, the impact of bad attributes is determined by the narrator, but in most cases, they have no effect.

**List of Some Attributes** (there are certainly many, many more, but I have written these for now):
- All weapons without distinction = Maximum damage, skill dice   

**List of Some Special Properties** (there are certainly many, many more, but I have written these for now):

- **Storing/Exchanging Weapons (all weapons)**    
    - Determines how long it will take for the character to store their weapon in the inventory or how long it will take to exchange one weapon for another.        
    - The normal value is 1 round. Each acceleration increases the price by 2, while each deceleration decreases the price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.        
- **Complexity of Use (mostly ranged weapons)**    
    - Adds or increases the CL that the character must overcome to hit their target.        
    - Below in the text is written the CL that ranged weapons should have. Each increase in CL decreases the price by 3, while each decrease increases the price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.        
- **Magazine Size (only ranged weapons)**    
    - Determines the number of shots after which the character must reload the weapon.        
    - The normal value is 4 shots per reload. Each additional shot increases the final price by 3, while each missing shot decreases the price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.        
- **Reloading Duration (only ranged weapons)**    
    - Determines the number of rounds during which the character will reload the weapon.        
    - The normal value is considered 1 round for reloading. Anything faster or slower increases (or decreases) the final price by 3.        
    - This attribute does not affect speed points.

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

##### Weapon or Shield or Armor

**These are**: Weapons, Shields, or Armor that a character has ready for combat. That is - they are not stored in a backpack, but are in hand or somewhere on the body.

**Weapon Consumption**:
- 1-2 small weapons consume 1 inventory point    
- 1 medium weapon consumes 2 inventory points    
- 1 large weapon consumes 3 inventory points    

**Armor Consumption**:
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|light armor]] consumes 1 inventory point    
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|medium armor]] consumes 2 inventory points    
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|heavy weapon]] consumes 3 inventory points    

>[!note] 
>Note When the type of weapon or armor cannot be determined, the item consumes 2 inventory points.


</div></div>


#### Basic Division of Weapons

Weapons are divided into those that are "**melee**" – such as swords, axes, hammers, etc. And those that are "**ranged and thrown**" – such as shurikens, pistols, submachine guns, etc. Every weapon must be categorized into one of these categories.

However, what to do in cases where some weapons can be used both for melee and ranged? For example, an axe that a character can throw at an enemy, or a shuriken that can be used as a dagger? This alternative use of the weapon is rolled as a skill (for example, " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] " when the character wants to throw their axe accurately, or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] " if the axe is very heavy. Or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] " when the character wants to use the shuriken as a dagger). In this alternative use, the weapon's attributes are ignored, meaning they add exactly 0 dice. This does not apply if the character has a combat specialization in throwing that weapon. On the other hand, this alternative use of the weapon can cause injury.

And what about shields? Those hand-held ones that can be used together with a sword? All shields are considered blunt medium-sized weapons; therefore, they have all the advantages and disadvantages of medium blunt weapons. A character can use a shield separately, but also together with a medium sword or spear. When a character wants to fight with a sword and shield at the same time, they must have a special talent for it. Without it, they can only attack with one weapon per round.

##### Melee Weapons

Melee weapons include swords, small axes, maces, sticks, hand protectors (or bare hands), and even a wrench. These are all objects that a character can grasp in one or both hands and use to attack an enemy standing nearby (within a range of about 0 to 6 meters, depending on the weapon's size).

The advantage of these weapons is that they do not need to overcome a challenge level for a successful attack. Additionally, they allow for maneuvers to deflect the enemy's attack. Among hand weapons, there are basic types that do not require special talent to use but cause only minimal damage (such as sticks, poles, or tools like a wrench).

The disadvantage of these weapons is the limited range of combat distances. Their maximum distance is "within reach" (4-5 meters), and the minimum is "close combat" (0-1 meter). However, this also depends on the specific type of weapon.

> [!question] 
> What if a melee weapon has a spell that shoots at a distance? In that case, the attack with the spell is considered a ranged weapon attack, as if the character had a pistol.

##### Ranged and Thrown Weapons

These include bows, crossbows, pistols, shurikens, kunai, submachine guns, and all items that can shoot projectiles or be thrown.

Their advantage is that they are not limited by greater distances. Their effective range is from " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Common Distance\|common]] " distance to " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Far\|far]] " (this of course depends on the type of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]]). If these ranged and thrown weapons are outside the range of hand-held weapons, the enemy (who owns a hand-held weapon) can only defend. In their defense, they cannot use their weapon. They can only use skills such as:

- " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] " (to dodge or perform a gymnastics maneuver),    
- or the skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] " (for running or performing an athletic maneuver),    
- or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] " (when they will actively defend with a shield or simply endure the injury).    

The disadvantage of ranged and thrown weapons is that the attacker must overcome a difficulty level that depends on the weapon's complexity, the distance, and whether the target is in cover. If the attacker wins the combat roll but does not overcome the difficulty, they cause no injury to the target (but the victory level remains, and they can choose another option).

Another disadvantage is that these weapons use ammunition. Hand-held thrown weapons such as knives, grenades, etc. have a specific number of uses. This means that the character has written in their inventory how many grenades they have. Once the character uses up these weapons, they lose them and must buy them again. As for firearms like submachine guns, pistols, etc., the exact number of bullets is not counted, but the number of shots after which the weapon must be reloaded. For example, a weapon can fire 6 times and then reload for 1 whole round.

A bow does not need to be reloaded because the character has a quiver of arrows, which takes up an extra inventory slot. Weapons that fire slowly, like crossbows, need to be reloaded. A crossbow can fire once and then must reload for 1 whole round.

###### Challenge Level for Hitting with Ranged and Thrown Weapons

Every ranged weapon is aimed in some way, and there is a difference between small weapons and large weapons. Therefore, every ranged weapon must have a so-called base Challenge level. This is the Challenge level that is later combined with the Challenge level of distance and the target's movement speed (according to the table below).

Base Challenge level:
- Small weapon = CL 1 (small weapons and throwing weapons)    
- Medium weapon = CL 2 (medium weapons and grenades)    
- Large weapon / difficult to handle = CL 3 (large weapons)    
- Very large weapon / very difficult to handle = CL 4 (huge weapons)

###### Challenge Table

| Distance / Target |              |            |     Static without cover      | Static 50% in cover | Static 90% in cover |
| :---------------: | :----------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: |
|       Melee       |    Close     |   0-1 m    | ranged weapons cannot be used |                     |                     |

- A walking target is considered a static target.    
- Every speed above 50 km/h adds +1 CL (50 = 1, 100 = 2, 150 = 3, etc.)

##### Type of Attack

Weapons are categorized by their type of attack to determine their effect on the enemy's armor. This classification also influences the narrative or secondary use of weapons.

###### Blunt Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through the force of impact, with the goal of breaking bones, causing concussions, and crushing the enemy. Examples include hammers, maces, nunchaku, various sticks, rods, pipe repair tools, as well as hands or hand protectors.

###### Sharp Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through the sharpness of the blade, with the goal of cutting, slashing, and severing. Examples include axes, knives, swords, and daggers.

###### Piercing Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through speed and thrusting force, with the goal of piercing the target. This category includes all ranged weapons (from bows and crossbows to pistols and submachine guns), as well as weapons designed for stabbing (such as spears, rapiers, etc.)

###### Explosive Weapons

These are weapons that cause damage through the expansive force of gas, chemical, or explosive mixtures, with the goal of tearing the target to pieces. Examples include grenades, explosive ammunition, or weapons that generate high pressure or shock waves.

Explosive weapons must specify their area of effect. Whether it is an explosion within a range of "Close 0-1 m" or an explosion within a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance\|range]] of "Normal 2-3 m."

##### Weapon Size

###### Hand Protectors

These are weapons that are worn directly on the hands to serve as protectors. This category also includes bare hands, for example, when a character loses their main weapon or is trained in hand-to-hand combat (such as kung fu).

In terms of size, these weapons can be up to 5 cm. This means that an object protruding from the protector can be up to 5 cm. As for magic, spells that use touch are considered hand protectors (e.g., a spell like "poisonous touch" is considered a weapon "hand protectors").

- In terms of range, these weapons **can** injure the target only in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m),    
- In "normal range" (2-3 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used upon victory,    
- And at other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all, meaning they are not counted in the combat roll.    

As for fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 1 enemy (+1 for each point in specialization).

And regarding any special advantages, besides being able to enter [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 04 - Combat#Hand-to-Hand Combat\|hand-to-hand combat]], they can do so immediately after disarming the enemy. This means that in the next combat round, they start in the "close combat" position, with combat priority—as if the attacker had the highest [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].

###### Small Weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/small weapons\|small weapons]] for one hand, which can have a maximum length of 15 cm. That's roughly the size of a hand with fingers.

Regarding range:
- Small melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m) or "normal range" (2-3 m).    
- In "within reach" combat (4-5 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used upon victory.    
- In other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    
- Small ranged weapons **can** be used in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m), "normal range" (2-3 m), and "within reach" combat (4-5 m).    
- At "further" distance (10-100 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- At other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 2 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

As for any special advantages, these weapons can enter hand-to-hand combat.

###### Medium-sized Weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/medium-sized weapons\|medium-sized weapons]] for one hand or both hands, which can have a maximum length of 60 cm (roughly the length of an arm with a shoulder).

Regarding range:

- Medium melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m), "normal range" (2-3 m), or "within reach" combat (4-5 m).    
- At a distance of "further 10 - 100 m," only **pacifist** combat options can be used.    
- At other distances, these weapons **cannot** be used at all (i.e., they are not counted in combat, and the character must use some maneuver instead).    
- Medium-sized ranged weapons **cannot** be used in "close combat" (i.e., 0 - 1 m) or at a distance of "far (600 - 1 km)."    
- In "normal range" combat (2-3 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- In "within reach" combat (4-5 m) and at "further" distance (10-100 m), they are used **without restrictions**.    

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 3 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

> [!note]
> Even though medium melee weapons can be used at a distance of 0 - 1 m or within reach (4 - 5 m), they do not gain any advantage during combat at this distance.

###### Big weapons

These are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Big weapons\|Big weapons]] for one or both hands, which can have a maximum length of 200 cm (slightly taller than a human).

Regarding range:

- Large melee weapons (e.g., swords) **can** injure the target in "normal range" (2 - 3 m) and "within reach" (4 - 5 m).    
- At a distance of "further" (10 - 100 m), only **pacifist** combat options can be used.    
- These weapons **cannot** be used at distances "close combat" (0 - 1 m), "even further" (200 - 500 m), and "far" (600 - 1 km).    
- Large ranged weapons **cannot** be used in "close combat" (0 - 1 m) or "normal range" (2 - 3 m).    
- In "within reach" combat (4 - 5 m), only **pacifist** victory options can be used.    
- At other distances, they can be used **without restrictions** (i.e., 200 m -- 1 km).

Regarding fighting multiple enemies, these weapons can fight against 4 enemies (+1 for each point in specialization).

As for any special advantages, these weapons can enter combat at a distance of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|within reach]], where they gain a bonus for “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 04 - Combat#Combat Within Reach\|within reach combat]]” (described below in the list of weapon modifiers).

(not exist = "armguard" type of firearms do not exist)

#### Ammunition for Weapons

Ammunition can change certain attributes of the weapon, such as attack, but it can also change the way the weapon is used in combat—for example, by adding an element or making the attack effective against invulnerable enemies (e.g., vampires).

The weight of the ammunition is always 1 (for approximately 50 bullets or arrows). Physical statistics do not affect the weight of the ammunition. For larger quantities or larger sizes of ammunition, the narrator decides its weight. In most stories, basic ammunition is not counted (the player can shoot as much as they want). However, if the narrator wishes, special ammunition can be limited by number (e.g., to 50 attacks). The type and special properties of the ammunition serve only as a modifier for the weapon's combat attack.

- **Normal Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that are considered standard in the given story. Basic bullets and arrows that do not change the weapon's attributes (price 2/box)        
- **Enhanced Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that are considered very good in the given story. They increase the natural attack. They may also have special properties like bullets that penetrate armor or can pierce dragon skin (price 4/box)        
- **Special Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that do something extra or change the way the weapon is used. For example, explosive arrows, airsoft bullets with acid, incendiary bullets, freezing bullets (or anything from the Borderlands universe).        
    - The properties of the ammunition, as well as the size of the effect, are determined by the narrator. The effect should influence at least 0 - 1 m. The duration of the effect is also determined by the narrator. It should last at least 1 round.        
    - (price 8/box)        
- **Magical Ammunition**    
    - i.e., projectiles that perform some spell upon firing. They need to be activated before firing, consuming the character's energy. For example, fireball arrows or bullets that turn into clay hands and stick the target to the ground or wall.        
    - (arrows attack +2, special effect max +5 = number of victories / direct damage effect when the player wins the combat roll. The narrator can change the ammunition's attributes.)        
    - The properties of the ammunition, as well as the size of the effect, are determined by the narrator. The effect should influence at least 0 - 1 m. The duration of the effect is also determined by the narrator. It should last at least 1 round.        
    - (price 16/box)

#### Weapon Modifiers / Circumstances

##### Unarmed Combat

When the character has no weapon, hand protectors, and no talent in unarmed combat (e.g., karate), they lose 2 dice from their combat roll.

##### Combat Without Weapon Talent

When the character has a weapon they have no talent or specialization for, they roll the combat roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the character is disarmed, only the "unarmed combat" modifier applies (meaning they lose only 2 dice even when disarmed).

##### Close combat

When the character fights at a distance of “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Close Combat\|Close Combat 0-1 m]]” and has the correct type of weapons (e.g., hand protectors or small melee weapons or small ranged weapons), the enemy's armor is completely ignored (as if the enemy had 0 armor).

Regarding hand protectors, they can immediately engage in close combat after disarming the enemy without needing another roll.

##### Combat Within Reach

When the character fights at a distance of “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Within Reach\|Within Reach 4-5 m]]” and has the correct type of weapons (e.g., large melee weapons or ranged or thrown weapons), half of their weapon's attack is reserved as victories (rounded down).

For example, if the character has a large axe with an attack of 4, 2 victories are reserved.

##### Weapon Cannot Be Used

When the character:
- attacks with a weapon at a distance where the weapon cannot be used,    
- or the weapon is broken (e.g., a submachine gun is jammed),    
- or circumstances do not allow the weapon to be used (e.g., a large weapon in a small tunnel), then the weapon is not counted in the combat roll.    

The narrator decides whether the character:
- will fight unarmed (see weapon modifier "unarmed combat"),    
- will fight with the weapon, but the weapon's attributes will not be counted (i.e., the weapon, talent, and specialization will contribute 0),    
- or will be able to use the weapon with attributes (like attack, talent, specialization), but the character will only be able to use deflecting attacks or pacifist victory options of a certain kind upon winning the roll.

##### Uneven Equipment

The character's and the enemy's equipment are at different technological levels. Suppose the character has medieval equipment (sword, cloth armor) and the enemy has modern equipment (bulletproof vest, submachine gun).

In such a case, the character with modern equipment will roll the dice with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|great advantage]].

### Armor

Armor is a passive protection that shields a character from damage in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]] or during a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|quick solution to the situation]]. The number of armor points is determined by the narrator. Unless otherwise specified, every character receives **0 armor points**.

Armor can be increased with items like helmets, gloves, or bulletproof vests. Armor can also be permanently increased by a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk\|natural trait]] the character is born with (e.g., a turtle's shell).

There is no maximum armor level, but it can only be reduced to zero. Armor does not go into negative numbers.

#### How Armor Works

Unless otherwise specified, armor is a passive protection that shields [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] by reducing the damage a character would receive from an attacker.

>[!example]
>- The enemy rolls 6 victories in their combat roll
>- The character rolls 2 victories in their combat roll.
> <br>
>- The character's health points should decrease by 4 points.
>- However, the character has 3 armor points.
>- Therefore, their health points decrease by only 1.

Although armor reduces damage, it does not reduce the victory level. So if a character wins the combat roll but does not cause any injury to the enemy, they can use other options listed in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|chapter on victory levels]].

#### Armor Strength

Each piece of protective gear adds armor points directly. All armor points (even from multiple items) are then totaled together. So if a character is wearing, for example, a helmet +1, body armor +3, and boots +2, their armor score would be 6. Armor is calculated separately only when an enemy or character decides to attack a specific part of the body (e.g., attacking the hands).

The armor level of a given item is not judged by the period or genre in which the story takes place. Whether it's medieval, sci-fi, or magical - an armor level of 1 represents weak or small armor, and a level of 5 represents large or high-quality armor.

1. Weak or small armor    
2. Below-average armor or medium armor    
3. Average armor or standard size    
4. Above-average armor or larger    
5. High-quality armor or largest

#### Armor Specialization

All information on specialization can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization#Specialization and Armor\|relevant chapter]]. But in short: the number of points a character invests in specialization for a certain type of armor (e.g., samurai armor) increases their armor points for that specific armor when equipped.

Armor specialization must be tied to a job, type of martial arts, or specific magic. A character cannot have a general light armor specialization for all kinds of light armor but must specify the type, such as light samurai armor.

#### Types of Armor

However, the rating of armor does not end with a number. Each armor must also have its type specified, which indicates which type of weapon the armor is resistant to and which it is weak against. In our RPG system, we divide armor by resistance (against weapons) into three types:

- **Light Armor**: resistant to one type of weapon. It has a weight of 1, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to multiple skills.    
- **Medium Armor**: resistant to two types of weapons. Its weight is 2, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to one skill.    
- **Heavy Armor**: resistant to three types of weapons. Its weight is 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it cannot add points to skills.    

This resistance can manifest in the game in various ways. Either the light armor gets damaged after each successful enemy attack, or the light armor won't protect the character as well. The narrator can decide which method to use, create their own method, or combine multiple methods.

##### Armor Damage

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain type of weapon. After each successful enemy attack, the armor is slightly damaged, reducing the armor points by 1. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the weak armor takes full damage.    
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain type of weapon. Therefore, it does not get damaged during a successful enemy attack. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the resistant armor takes only half damage.    
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)    

Damaged armor can be repaired by a blacksmith, or if the character has the appropriate talent and tools, they can repair the armor themselves.

##### Armor Effectiveness

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 2 armor points block only 1 damage point.    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is weak against the given weapon). The enemy receives 3 damage points.        
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 1 armor point blocks 2 damage points (i.e., the number of damage points is halved, rounded down).    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is resistant to the given weapon). The enemy receives 0 damage points.        
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)

##### In Our Universe

In our story universe, armor is divided according to the type of weapon attack it faces (see the list):

###### Against Blunt Weapons and Explosives
- This armor is resistant to blunt weapons and explosives. This means that blunt weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Blunt Weapons\|Blunt Weapons]] are: hammers, maces, clubs, and similar. Also includes blunt throwing weapons.)    
- (Explosives fall under [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Explosive Weapons\|Explosive Weapons]]. These include: grenades, explosive arrows, explosive spells, and similar.)

###### Against Sharp Weapons
- This armor is resistant to sharp weapons. This means that sharp weapons do not harm this armor. 
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Sharp Weapons\|Sharp Weapons]] are: axes, swords, katanas, knives, shurikens, and similar. Also includes sharp throwing weapons.)

###### Against Piercing Weapons
- This armor is resistant to piercing weapons. This means that piercing weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- Applies to ranged and stabbing weapons.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Piercing Weapons\|Ranged Weapons]] are: arrows, bullets—everything shot from a weapon (not throwing weapons).    
- (Stabbing weapons: rapiers, spears, and other weapons designed for stabbing.)

###### Mixed Armor
- A character's armor is "mixed" when they wear pieces of various types of armor on their body.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

 ###### Without Armor
- A character is "without armor" when they have no items or clothing on their body that could be considered armor. Or when it is natural armor, like a turtle's shell.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

#### Armor and Elements

In our universe, the rule is that every armor is weak against all elements unless it has magical resistance against a particular element.

Regarding elements in general, our story universe follows the rule that all elements are equal. This means that no element is inherently weak against another element.

However, if the narrator wants certain elements to be stronger or weaker against each other (similar to the game Pokémon), they can follow the chapter on "[[RPG - Pocket Monsters#Elements\|Pocket Monsters]]."

#### Energy Armor

This is protection that uses energy (magic or photons) instead of solid materials (such as iron). Energy armor functions similarly to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]. When a character takes damage, their energy armor points are depleted before their health points. Once the energy armor is depleted, the character is no longer protected.

Such armor can also be recharged. The method depends on the story (sometimes a specific item or battery is needed, or if it's magic, the shield is charged from the character's energy through a spell). The narrator sets the limitations of energy armor and its recharging options. The narrator may decide that the armor can be recharged automatically after combat or, in certain cases (using a spell or item), even during combat.

Energy armor does not affect the character's weight. Some weapons may be more effective against it (meaning some weapons deplete 2 or 3 points instead of 1). Some elements may completely ignore it (e.g., a poisonous cloud that depletes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] directly).

In close combat, energy armor functions normally.

#### Magical Armor Abilities

Magical properties of armor are special abilities that provide additional protection or advantage to a character. To activate these properties, the character must meet certain conditions. Some magical properties are activated by spells, or a combination of talent, skill, or specialization. Other magical properties are activated when certain numbers or ranges of numbers are rolled on the dice.

> [!example]
> * **Thorn Armor** - When a 1 is rolled on the dice, the enemy receives as much damage as the number of dice with a 1.
> * **Ice Armor** - Reduces the speed of nearby characters by 1 point (speed) for as many rounds as the character rolled victories.
> * **Spider Armor** - The character can use the "pull" spell. It combines Dexterity + specialization in Spider Armor. The character chooses a target, and the narrator determines the difficulty level.

These magical properties can only be activated when the character has a specialization for a specific type of armor. So if the character has a specialization in heavy armor and is wearing heavy armor with magical properties, they can use the magical properties. If they had a different armor, they could not. The number of points invested in specialization adds dice to the roll or shifts the activation threshold.

- Specialization 1, 2 = when a 1 is rolled    
- Specialization 3, 4 = when a 1, 2 is rolled    
- Specialization 5, 6 = when a 1, 2, 3 is rolled (3 is the maximum)

> [!example]
> For protective properties, numbers 1, 2, 3 are used. For supportive or offensive properties, numbers 4, 5, 6 are used.

As for the cost, magical properties are considered armor points. So if heavy armor has 3 armor points and magical properties add 2 points, the cost will be the same as if the heavy armor had 5 armor points.

In terms of weight, magical properties do not count towards the weight. However, the narrator can change this and, for example, increase the armor's weight.

### Combat Maneuvers and Actions During Battle

Maneuvers or actions during battle are divided into three categories: "Slow Action," "Fast Action," and "Very Fast Action."

- "**Slow Action**" requires concentration or more than 2 seconds to complete, or it results in a full injury to the enemy (or another full disadvantage).    
- "**Fast Action**" requires less concentration or can be done within 2 seconds, or it has a smaller impact on the enemy's injury (or another disadvantage).    
- "**Very Fast Action**" is something that requires the least concentration and can be done within one second, or it has a minimal impact on the enemy (not resulting in any injury or limitation), or it is an action that must be performed (e.g., a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|activity check]]). The decision to perform a very fast action is made by the narrator.

During battle, a character can perform only one "slow action" or two "fast actions."

A character can (but does not have to) perform one additional "very fast action" during battle (this does not affect the total number of actions a character can perform during battle, as its execution is decided solely by the narrator).


##### More Actions

When a character runs out of actions and needs to do something else, they can sacrifice some of their points to take an additional action.

A character gains 1 fast action by sacrificing:
- (either) 2 dice from the next roll (this reduction lasts until the end of the battle)    
- (or) 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]    
- (or) 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]

A character gains 1 slow action by sacrificing:
- (either) 4 dice from the next roll (this reduction lasts until the end of the battle)    
- (or) 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]    
- (or) 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]

The sacrifice of points can occur before rolling the dice, or as a reaction to a dice roll (either their own or the enemy's).

A character can make only one sacrifice per dice roll. It’s best to use the acquired actions in the same round, although actions can carry over from one round to the next. This means that if a character does not use all their actions (e.g., they have one fast action left), they can use this unused action in the next round (but only in the next one - actions created from sacrifices do not carry over indefinitely).

#### Maneuvers by Impact on the Enemy

Maneuvers are also classified by their impact on the enemy into:
- Offensive (causing damage to the enemy)    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] (where the activity helps the character or allies)    
- Pacifistic (not causing damage to the enemy but disadvantaging them, e.g., stunning)

#### List of Maneuvers

Below is a list of maneuvers. It’s divided into categories for clarity, but the character can choose from any category and any maneuver each round. The character is not restricted in this regard.

##### Movement

Movement allows a character to get into a better position, hide, or dodge an attack. It can also enable the character to use their speed to injure the enemy.

###### Quick Move - vf

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed before rolling dice - very fast action.

**Description:** It is a quick move within 2 meters or within 1 second. For example, when a character passes through a door, hides behind a cupboard (must be close by), or jumps through a window (when standing next to it). It must be a move that does not require any dice roll and has no level of complexity. When the move requires a dice roll or has a level of complexity, "quick move" is replaced with "regular move."

**Repetition:** Quick move can be used only once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. There are no benefits from specialization or talent.

###### Regular Move - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed (or rolled) before rolling dice - fast action.

**Description:** It is a move within a larger area than 2 meters or lasting more than 2 seconds. For example, when a character passes through a door (from a distance), hides behind a cupboard (even if it is further away), or jumps through a window (even if it is further away). It is a movement that requires a skill roll against the level of complexity.

For a “regular move,” you roll:

- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] (for speed or distance),    
- or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] (for handling difficult terrain, e.g., height differences or deep snow),    
- or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] (when jumping over an obstacle).    

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]] is determined by meters - for every additional 2 meters, add 1 CL (starting from 0, so 4m = CL 1, 6m = CL 2, etc.), and the complexity of the obstacle also increases CL (+1 for something easier, +2 for something complex, +3 for something very complex).

**Repetition:** Regular move can be repeated several times in one round, even between two attacks (the character moves, attacks, and moves again). It works as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent for movement, they can use it for this maneuver.

 ###### Shift in Combat Distance - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed before rolling dice - slow action.

**Description:** It is a shift in combat distance by 1, for example, from close combat to regular combat, etc. This move does not require any skill roll.

**Repetition:** The shift in combat distance can be used multiple times in one combat round, but consecutively (e.g., the character shifts by 1+1 positions within [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance\|combat distance]]).

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. There are no benefits from specialization or talent.

###### Stealthy Approach - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action performed (or rolled) before the main attack - slow action.

**Description:** It involves controlling the character's movement so that no one sees or hears them. The purpose of this movement is to get the character into a better position, or ideally, directly behind the enemy, where they can neutralize them quickly.

For a "secret approach," the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill is rolled against the enemy's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill as a passive conflict (i.e., in the case of a tie, the enemy wins). The enemy may receive more or fewer dice depending on the circumstances (e.g., fog or dry leaves that rustle), or based on the items they have (e.g., night vision).

The narrator decides how many times the character must roll "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]]" to get behind the enemy (or to do what they want to do). This number is determined by meters - for every additional 2 meters, add 1 roll (so 2m = 1 roll, 4m = 2 rolls, 6m = 3 rolls, etc.). The narrator can increase or decrease the CL based on the obstacle or circumstance (+1 for something easier, +2 for something complex, +3 for something very complex).

If the character wins all the rolls in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill, they reach the enemy from behind and can make an attack against CL0. Each win counts as direct damage to the enemy (or as a level of victory), and the enemy's armor is ignored.

If the character loses, the enemy sees them and can attack. The wins the enemy gained in the last roll carry over to the next attack.

**Repetition:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] is rolled every round. If the character is revealed, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] can no longer be rolled.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent for silent movement, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Charge - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled instead of an attack - slow action.

**Description:** Charge is a combat maneuver based on the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]]." In this maneuver, the character runs towards the enemy and uses their speed and weight to knock them down. There must be a sufficient distance between the character and the enemy. Charge can be used within "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Reach\|Reach]]" distance (4m - 5m).

Each character (regardless of whether they have points in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]]" or not) receives an additional +3 dice for their roll during a charge. If the attacking character wins, they knock the enemy to the ground (see the "[[RPG - Levels of Victory\|Combat Result]]" chapter, option “[[RPG - Levels of Victory#Knockdown (pacif)\|Knockdown]]").

Defense against Charge includes: Resistance, Dodge, or a regular attack if the character has a shield or any loaded firearm.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, the charge can be rolled again as a normal roll. It can be used against another enemy. It can only be used against the same enemy when the character and enemy are within "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance#Reach\|Reach]]" distance (4m - 5m).

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate specialization that can be used for the charge, they can use it for this maneuver. (Talent cannot be used since Charge is a damaging maneuver).

##### Attack

Attack allows a character to damage the enemy or to disadvantage their enemy.

###### Pre-Attack Check - vf

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - very fast action.

**Description:** This is an activity check that determines if the character can attack when in challenging conditions (e.g., swimming in deep water). The character must first roll the skill related to the conditions (e.g., in deep water, the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill is rolled), with the complexity level determined by the narrator based on the circumstances.

The pre-attack check functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, the pre-attack check can be rolled again. It still functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Analysis of Weakness - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** Weakness detection determines if the character notices something that can be used in battle, a weakness of the enemy (e.g., bad posture, poorly fitted armor, improper weapon handling).

Weakness detection functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] and is rolled as the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once in battle.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. Without them, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Analysis of an Enemy  - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** The character thinks and searches their memory for information that could help in damaging the enemy. Analysis functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] and is rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] and can be combined with an appropriate item (e.g., a monster book).

**Repetition:** It can only be used once in battle.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. Without them, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Searching for an Item - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** The character finds an item that will help in battle (e.g., a bottle of gasoline, sand, rag). Searching for an item functions as an auxiliary roll and is rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], against the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Challenge Level\|level of complexity]], determined by a luck roll. (So if the character wants to find an item, first roll luck and then roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]).

The level (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|strength]]) of the item is determined by the number of wins the character gets from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill roll (which was reduced by the level of complexity).

The item found can be used in the next round, or if there are still unused actions, it can be used in the same round (see use of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] item). The item must be used as soon as possible and cannot be saved for later. It also cannot be sacrificed.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|Luck Dice]] and CL:
1. Massive Misfortune = CL 5 or CL +3    
2. Great Misfortune = CL 4 or CL +2    
3. Slight Misfortune = CL 3 or CL +1    
4. Slight Luck = CL 2 or CL -1    
5. Great Luck = CL 1 or CL -2    
6. Massive Luck = CL 0 or CL -3

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. In this case, it functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent, it can be used for this maneuver.

###### Vehicle Use - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** A character can use their vehicle in battle. They can maneuver it to ram the enemy or position it for better shooting. This maneuver is rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] with the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] skill connected to a talent related to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (e.g., fighter pilot).

Note: Though referred to as a vehicle, this maneuver applies to all machines that can be piloted, including aircraft, spaceships, and so on.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It still functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. Without them, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Use of an Animal - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** Control of commands for the animal, or control of the use of surrounding animals (e.g., scaring elephants). This control serves to make the animals attack the enemy or somehow make their life difficult.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Other skills#Talking to Animals / Controlling Animals\|Animal Use]] is rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|self-assistance roll]] and is rolled as a combination of any one skill from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] and a talent related to working with animals (e.g., beast tamer). The use of animals must be approved by the narrator.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. Without them, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Deceiving the Enemy - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled before the attack - fast action.

**Description:** The character uses tricks to deceive the enemy. For example, pretending to attack from the other side or feigning defense.

Deceiving the enemy is rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|self-assistance roll]] and is rolled using the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] skill. If the character has an appropriate talent, it can also be used (e.g., illusionist, circus performer).

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]]. Without it, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Weapon as Armor - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action used during the attack - slow action. (No dice are rolled)

**Description:** The character must state that they are going to use their weapon as armor before the dice roll occurs.

All offensive attributes of the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|melee weapon]] are "transformed" into armor and added to the armor the character is wearing. The type of armor will be the same as the armor the character is wearing. No dice roll is required for this maneuver.

Note - Only melee weapons can be used. Ranged or thrown weapons cannot be used.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] in the weapon. Without specialization, this maneuver cannot be used.

###### Regular Attack / Counterattack - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled as an attack - slow action

**Description:** It is a regular [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|attack]] with a weapon, without a weapon, or with anything intended to harm the enemy. All rules about weapons and combat apply to this maneuver.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** When a character uses a weapon that requires a talent or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] and does not have either, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Half Attack / Counterattack - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled as an attack - fast action

**Description:** It is an attack with a weapon, without a weapon, or with anything intended to harm the enemy. The number of dice the character can use in the battle is halved (and rounded down).

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** When a character uses a weapon that requires a talent or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] and does not have either, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Deflect Attack - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled instead of an attack - fast action

**Description:** Deflecting an attack serves to completely block the enemy's attack. If the character wins the combat roll, the enemy takes no damage. The character does not gain any benefits from a successful counterattack. It is rolled as a regular combat roll. Deflecting an attack can only be done with melee weapons.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** When a character uses a weapon that requires a talent or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] and does not have either, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Brace - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled instead of an attack - fast action.

**Description:** Bracing serves as a defense against a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 04 - Combat#Charge - s\|Charge]] or any object that is "charging" (e.g., rolling barrels). It is based on the "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" skill. The character creates a barrier with their body for the enemy to collide with.

Bracing is rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|self-assistance roll]]. Regardless of whether the character has points in the "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" skill or not, they receive an additional +1 die for their roll. A shield can be used in this maneuver (adding extra dice to the roll).

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per round.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent or specialization, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Dodging - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] action rolled instead of an attack - fast action.

**Description:** Dodging serves as a defense against the enemy's attack, where the character dodges the enemy. They can jump aside or perform some gymnastic maneuver. Dodging is based on the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]," which is the only one that provides dice for this maneuver (the character does not receive any additional dice for Dodging).

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has an appropriate talent or specialization, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Damage Absorption - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action used instead of an attack - fast action.

**Description:** Damage absorption serves to reduce the damage that the character would receive. It is rolled as the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] skill, without the use of talent or items (which can only be used for sacrifice). Armor, shield, or weapon can be used in this roll - the number of points in armor (shield or weapon) is converted into dice, which increases the number of dice in the damage absorption roll.

The roll is made against the enemy's attack. The number of wins the character rolls is the amount by which their damage is reduced. The result of this roll is final, and the damage cannot be reduced further by armor.

Damage absorption serves to absorb the enemy's attack without causing any injury to the enemy. The character does not gain any benefits from a successful counterattack.

**Repetition:** It can only be used once per combat round.

**Specialization:** Talent and specialization are not used for this maneuver.

##### Magic

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]] allows a character to damage their enemy, limit them in some way, or help their allies. The term “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]]” refers to all special traits, superpowers, magical abilities, or other unique skills of the character, including the use of sci-fi technology.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] Spell, Fast - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled instead of an attack - fast action

**Description:** The character casts a spell that helps them or someone else. This spell must be cast quickly (within 1 second) and must not directly harm the enemy (e.g., setting them on fire). The character can conjure a shield, a sword, or can speed up an ally, or extinguish them if they are on fire.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** The character must have talent. If they do not have talent, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the spell is quite complex, they roll at a great disadvantage.

###### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] Spell, Slow - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled instead of an attack - slow action

**Description:** The same as a “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] Spell, Fast,” but casting this spell can take longer than 1 second.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, it can be rolled again. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** The character must have talent. If they do not have talent, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the spell is quite complex, they roll at a great disadvantage.

###### Spell Charging - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action rolled instead of an attack - slow action

**Description:** This maneuver is used when the CL for the spell is too high or when the wizard wants to strengthen their spell. The wizard focuses on their spell, charging it with full power. During the round, the character rolls their normal dice roll (as if casting the spell) against the CL, which is determined by the length of the charging time. The duration of the character's focus on their spell determines the CL of the spell. If the CL is high, the character can spread it out - but each round must have at least CL 2 (exceptionally 1). Thus, the CL for each charging round of the spell should be 2 (exceptionally 1).

If the character wins the roll (passes the complexity level), the number of wins is recorded. If the roll fails (does not pass the complexity level), nothing happens (0 wins are recorded). In the final charging round, all wins from all rounds are added up into one final total, which will be considered definitive.

**Repetition:** With a sacrifice, the charging roll can be rolled again in the same round. It then functions as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

**Specialization:** The character must have a talent or specialization. If they have neither, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the spell is quite complex, they roll at a great disadvantage.

###### Regular Attack / Counterattack with Spell - s

Used the same way as a regular [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|attack / counterattack with weapons]].

Used the same way as a half [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|attack / counterattack with weapons]].

###### Deflecting Attack with Spell - f

Used the same way as regular deflecting attack with weapons.

##### Morale

Morale affects the enemy's will to fight. Morale is the only attribute that falls under [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]. All maneuvers are performed using skills from this attribute. Another difference is that all maneuvers in the morale category are [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]], meaning they do not directly harm the enemy. Additionally, all rolls are considered auxiliary, meaning they either increase the number of dice an ally can roll or decrease the number of dice an enemy can roll. The narrator determines the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Challenge Level\|level of complexity]].

###### Communication Very Fast - vf

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] action, no roll needed, used for the sake of the story - very fast action.

**Description:** The character shouts something to their allies - one or two words. This shout (or communication) must not last more than 1 second.

The character can shout to their friends that an animal is charging at them, or to throw dynamite. They inform their allies of something useful - something they didn't know that could pose a threat. Thanks to this, they can react to the danger.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] can be used beforehand as an auxiliary roll or a skill roll, through which the character discovers important facts.

###### Searching for the Enemy's Psychological Weakness - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] activity, thrown before an attack - quick action.

**Description:** The character looks at the enemy, observes their behavior and body language, and thinks about what psychological weaknesses the enemy might have. Do they have a phobia? Are they afraid of something? Is there something that can anger or deceive them?

This maneuver is performed as the skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intuition\|Intuition]] " and serves as a supporting roll for other maneuvers of the morale type.

**Repetition:** It can be used only once in combat.

**Specialization:** This maneuver requires [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. Without them, the character rolls with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Intimidation / Unsettling / Angering - f

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] activity, thrown before an attack - quick action.

**Description:** The character starts shouting or cursing, or rapidly moving their hands—just to intimidate, unsettle, or anger the enemy in some way.

The skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intimidation\|Intimidation]] " is used. It serves as a supporting roll for all other maneuvers of every type.

**Repetition:** It can be used only once in combat.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has a suitable talent, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Negotiation - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] activity, thrown before an attack - slow action.

**Description:** The character will try to persuade the enemy or negotiate with them (e.g., attempt to bribe them with money to stop fighting). This is sincere persuasion, meaning the character is serious. If it involves [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]], where the character intends to deceive the enemy, then the skill Deception should be used (see below).

The skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] " is used. It serves as a supporting roll for all other maneuvers (of every type). It may end the combat with the enemy.

**Repetition:** It can be used only once in combat.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has a suitable talent, they can use it for this maneuver.

###### Deception - s

**Type:** [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] activity, thrown before an attack - slow action.

**Specialization:** This maneuver does not require [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] or talent. If the character has a suitable talent, they can use it for this maneuver.

##### Other Maneuvers

If the character cannot find a suitable maneuver, they can create their own. However, it must be approved by the narrator. The narrator also determines whether it is a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|attack]] roll, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] roll. This is important for more complex maneuvers, which may require talent (mainly for supporting or useful rolls) or specialization (mainly for attack rolls, sometimes for supporting ones).

Similarly, the narrator decides whether the maneuver will be thrown instead of an attack roll, or used before the attack, or after the enemy's attack. They can also determine whether the character can use their weapon during the maneuver.

Most of these maneuvers can only be used once per round.

###### Quick Use of an Item - f

**Type:** Quick action.

**Description:** The character quickly uses one of their items. Quickly, as in within 1 second (e.g., throws gasoline into the fire, while already holding the canister).

###### Slow Use of an Item - s

**Type:** Slow action.

**Description:** The character uses one of their items. The use of this item takes more than 1 second (e.g., bandaging a hand). This maneuver is performed as a skill (with the narrator deciding which [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]] it will be).

###### Performing a Quick Maneuver - f

**Type:** Quick action.

**Description:** The character performs a quick maneuver, which execution does not exceed 2 seconds.

This maneuver is performed as a skill combined with a talent or specialization. The narrator decides which [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]], talent, or specialization will be used. If the character does not have a suitable talent or specialization (and the situation specifically requires talent or specialization), then the character will roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

###### Performing a Slow Maneuver - s

**Type:** Slow action.

**Description:** The character performs a slower maneuver or one that requires greater concentration.

This maneuver is performed as a skill combined with a talent or specialization. The narrator decides which [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]], talent, or specialization will be used. If the character does not have a suitable talent or specialization (and the situation specifically requires talent or specialization), then the character will roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

### Combat circumstances

In combat, various things can happen that affect its course. Below is a list of combat circumstances and their impacts on the fight.

#### Advantageous position

This circumstance occurs when the character gets into a better position than the enemy. The enemy may fall into water or be trapped in bushes, while the character stands firmly on the ground.

The advantaged character rolls with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|advantage]], or if the advantage is very significant, with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|great advantage]].

#### Surprise

"Surprise" occurs when the character attacks an enemy who is attacking someone else. Or when the enemy is engaged in another activity during which they are "oblivious to the surrounding world".

During surprise, the character gets +2 extra dice on their roll.

(The enemy's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] functions normally.)

#### Dual Wielding

When the character has the talent for dual wielding and attacks with two [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapons]], the attacks from both weapons are combined.

#### Fighting multiple enemies

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|Fighting]] multiple enemies occurs when the character decides to attack several attackers or when several attackers attack the character. In the case of fighting multiple enemies, the combat roll is thrown the same as in any other fight. However, the character's victories are compared against the victories of all participating opponents - each individually as if fighting 1vs1.

The number of enemies the character can fight and injure is limited by the size of their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]].

- Hand protectors / unarmed fighting = 1 attacker    
- Small weapons = 2 attackers    
- Medium weapons = 3 attackers    
- Large weapons = 4 attackers

The number of enemies increases according to how many points the character has in specialization (+1 for each point).

When there are more enemies, if the character [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|wins]], they can only injure a certain number of enemies (for example, 2). The remaining enemies who lost the fight - the character deflects the attack. The narrator decides which enemies this applies to.


</div></div>


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/05-combat/rpg-victory-levels/#victory-levels" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



### Victory levels

The outcome of the action is the final phase of the combat round, in which the winner of that combat round is determined, as well as what happens to the loser of that combat round. The winner of the combat round is the character who rolled the most victories. The number of their victories is subtracted from the number of victories of the character who lost the combat roll, and the remainder is converted into the so-called victory level. The winner can inflict injury on their enemy, disarm them, or do other things—depending on the number of victories achieved.

In the case when the combat roll is tied, meaning both sides rolled the same number of victories, the combat round ends in a draw. In this case, the characters' attacks are simply deflected, or they miss each other.

> [!example]
> - A knight and a bandit are fighting each other.
> - The knight rolls their combat roll and gets 2 victories.
> - The bandit rolls their combat roll and gets 4 victories.
> - The bandit won the combat roll and achieved a victory level of 2.

The attacker who achieved a certain victory level can choose one option from the list below. When making the selection, they must consider whether they are a pacifist (which requires using a pacifist option) and what weapon they attacked with, as the weapon determines the level of injury ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|see the weapons chapter]]).

#### Reservation of Victories

The character who won the combat round can choose only one option from the available victory levels. If the character achieved more victories than necessary for the chosen option, the remaining victories remain unused. However, these victories are not wasted because the victories that the character did not use in their combat round carry over to the next combat roll. These victories will reduce the total number of dice the character can roll in the next combat roll—thus reserving the victories for the next roll.

> [!info] In-game, it will look like this: :
> The attacker rolled 6 victories and used the option from victory level 4.
> Therefore, they have 2 unused victories left. These victories will carry over to the second round.
> If the attacker has 8 dice for the combat roll, they will lose 2 dice in the next round (as they are automatically converted into victories), and the next combat roll will be thrown with 6 dice.

The reservation must be approved by the narrator, and victories cannot be carried over indefinitely.

#### Victory Levels

The character who won the combat round can choose one of the available options based on the number of victories they achieved. These options are sorted according to the level required to activate them. However, the character can choose a lower level option, even if they achieved more victories.

##### Victory Level 1

###### Change in Combat Distance (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack and quickly moves to a better position. This increase (or decrease) in combat distance between the enemy and the character lasts until another change in distance occurs (e.g., if the enemy wins the combat round and uses this option).

- For every **1 victory level**, the character can change their combat distance by 1.    
- The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the distance the character covers (+1 for each point).    
- If the character has unused points from weapon specialization (e.g., the distance can be changed by 1, but the character has 3 points in specialization), the unused points reserve victories for the next round.

###### Gaining Initiative (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack, slowing them down and gaining an advantage. This initiative gain lasts for 1 round.
- For every **1 victory level**, the character advances 1 level in combat initiative in the next round (as if they suddenly had a higher REF by 1 point).    
- The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the distance the character covers (+1 for each point).     
- If the character has unused points from weapon specialization (e.g., the initiative can be changed by 1, but the character has 3 points in specialization), the unused points reserve victories for the next round.

###### Stagger (pacifist)

Pacifist option. For each 1 victory level, the enemy loses 1 die in the next round. The loss of dice applies only for 1 round.

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the number of dice the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

###### Adding Damaging Points (optional)

When the narrator uses other points than those already in our RPG system, this option becomes available. If not, this option is ignored.

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the number of offensive points the enemy receives (+1 for each point).

For each 1 victory level, the enemy receives 1 offensive point. This could be pain, stress, heat, etc. The rules for offensive points are found in the chapter [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Other points\|Various points]].

> [!example]
> **Pain**
> Pain points are used when the attacker causes pain instead of injury to their victim. The attacker can exchange 1 victory level for 1 pain point (which the victim receives). When the victim accumulates 10 pain points, they can no longer fight and drop out of the combat as the pain becomes unbearable and they pass out. The victim can use 1 health point to "cleanse" 3 pain points.

###### Injury (dmg)

Injury is an offensive option. For each 1 victory level, the enemy receives 1 injury point. The maximum amount of injury is determined by the weapon, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|specialization]] for that weapon, and the enemy's armor.

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the amount of injury the enemy receives (+1 for each point).

> [!example]
> The character rolled their attack roll and achieved 4 victories.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 1, they will deal 1 damage to the enemy.
> If the character has a weapon with attack 3, they will deal 3 damage to the enemy.

##### Victory Level 2

###### Gaining a Quick Action (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack, slowing them down and gaining an advantage.

- For every **2 victory levels**, the character gains +1 quick action in the next round.

###### Damaging Armor  (pacifist)

The character uses their weapon to damage the enemy's armor. For every 2 victory levels, the enemy loses 1 armor point until the end of the battle.

If the enemy has armor that is resistant to the character's weapon, the armor damage is halved (rounded down).

The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the amount of armor the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

###### Poškodenie zbrane (pacifist)

The character uses their weapon to damage the enemy's weapon. For every 2 victory levels, the enemy loses 1 point from the weapon's attack attribute until the end of the battle.

The number of points the attacker has invested in their combat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the amount of armor the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

(Attack attributes of the weapon are considered to be all attributes the weapon possesses that help the character. This includes magic, reloading speed, etc. The player must specify which attribute they want to reduce.)

##### Victory Level  3

###### Pain (pacifist)

The character inflicts an unpleasant injury on the enemy, such as scratching or striking them hard. It's nothing serious, but the enemy will feel it until the end of the fight.

- For every **3 victory levels**, the enemy loses 1 die from their attack until the end of the fight.    
- The number of points the character has invested in their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|weapon specialization]] increases the number of dice the enemy loses (+1 for each point).

###### Disarmament (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character uses their speed and skill to disarm the enemy. The enemy will be disarmed until the end of the fight (but at least for 1 whole combat round).

To find their weapon again, the enemy needs to overcome a CL determined by the number of victories from the character's roll. They roll the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]. Finding the weapon is considered a quick action.

###### Knockdown (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character uses their speed or strength to knock down the enemy. The knocked-down enemy cannot move, cannot change combat distances, and can only defend.

To stand up again, the enemy needs to overcome a DL determined by the number of victories from the character's roll. They roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]. The attempt to stand up is considered a quick action.

##### Victory Level 4

###### Gaining a Slow Action (pacifist)

This is a pacifist option. The character deflects the enemy's attack, slowing them down and gaining an advantage.

- For every **4 victory levels**, the character gains +1 slow action in the next round.

###### Severing a Limb (dmg)

This is an offensive option. The character severs the enemy's arm or leg (or another limb). The enemy permanently loses 1 whole attribute (refer to the list of disadvantages - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Disabling Characteristic#item 6 - Missing Limb\|missing limb]]). Additionally, the enemy receives a bleeding status, losing 1 health point per round until the bleeding is stopped.

The difficulty of stopping the bleeding is determined by the number of victories from the character's roll.

##### Victory Level 5 and Above

###### K.O. (dmg / pacifist )

When the character's number of victories is higher by 1 than the remaining health points of the enemy (along with the remaining armor points), the character can choose one of these options:

- **K.O. (? dmg/pacif - decided by the narrator)**    
    - The enemy falls into a coma and drops out of the fight. If the character wants to additionally kill the enemy, they must overcome a difficulty level of 1 in their combat roll. The enemy's armor is not counted during this attack.        
- **Surrender (pacif)**    
    - The character forces the enemy to surrender. The enemy drops out of the fight, and the character can also bind them (automatically, without any dice roll).        
- **Death (dmg)**    
    - The character kills the enemy with one brutal strike.
