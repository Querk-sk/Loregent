### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]
( or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/HP\|HP]] )

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] indicate how much damage a character can take before dying. The number of health points is determined by the narrator.

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health]]**. These can be increased by items such as organic shields, magical amulets, and the like. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] also increase when a character invests points into [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]].

#### Health Consumption

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] serve as a cap. With each damage taken, the character's health points decrease. When health points drop to 0, the character dies (unless the narrator decides otherwise).

A character can get injured in battle – that is, when they lose a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat#Kolá v boji\|combat round]] and the enemy injures them. A character can also get injured if they fail the challenge level in a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Quick Reaction\|quick reaction]] (for example, falling from a great height), or they can get injured from an ongoing condition (such as being poisoned).

Each damage received by the character **does not reduce** the number of dice they can use for their roll. _(This rule is still being tested.)_

- Injury 1 = - 0 dice    
- Injury 2 = - 0 dice    
- Injury 3 = - 0 dice    
- Injury 4 = - 0 dice

>[!note]
>- The narrator can treat [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] as a resource - where points are spent when injured.
>- Alternatively, they can be seen as a threshold - where the character accumulates injuries, and when the amount of injury equals the health points, the character dies.
>- Which approach the narrator chooses is up to them, our RPG system doesn't mind either way.

#### Health Protection

Health can be protected during the game by:

- Before the dice roll, using a sacrifice to gain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|advantage]] (so that numbers 3, 4, 5, or 6 count as victories on the dice).    
- After the dice roll, using [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|sacrifice]] to add victories.    
- During combat, health can be protected, besides the mentioned options, by choosing a suitable [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]].    
- Or by using armor to absorb damage.

#### Healing Injuries

When a character is injured, how do they heal?
- Natural regeneration (where the body heals itself),    
- Treatment (where the character heals themselves, or someone else comes to treat the character),    
- With the help of items (when the character drinks a health potion),    
- Or with the help of machines (surgical chamber).

##### Natural Regeneration

Injury heals with rest, where the character sleeps through the night (about 8 hours). The narrator can decide whether the character regenerates 1 health point per night, or less (depending on the story and the difficulty of the game).

Alternatively, the character must roll dice for their skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]” against a **challenge level of 3** for their regeneration. (The narrator can adjust this level, for example, if the character is also poisoned, it can be increased).

In this case, the rolls are as follows:
- 3 dice as a base    
- plus [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]    
- plus [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]    
- plus (dice for regenerative items, such as medicines)    
- ! The number of dice for regeneration is never reduced due to missing [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] !

The number of health points healed is equal to the number of victories rolled over the difficulty level.

The narrator can decide that for their story, it is better if the regeneration is slower. For example, instead of 1 health point, the character regenerates only 0.1. So, if there were 6 victories, it would mean 0.6

##### Regenerative Items

Regenerative items are items that help a character in healing. During rest, only one item can be used.

The attributes of regenerative items are:
- **Usage** - how many times the item can be used -> i.e., for how many rests it can be used. If the item has infinite usage, the cost is increased by 10.    
- **Regeneration** - adds dice to the roll    
- **Simplification** - reduces the challenge level for the regenerative roll.    
- **Healing** – adds whole health points

> [!example]
>* Bandage -> usage 3x (3 dice rolls), adds +1 die to regeneration or healing
>* Injection to stop bleeding -> usage 1 dice roll. Regeneration simplification 2 (i.e., minus 2 CL)
>* Ring of regeneration – heals 0.5 of an injury each night
>* Aura of slow healing - adds +2 dice to the regenerative roll

###### Cost of Regenerative Items

The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|cost]] is calculated the same way as for other items (but to save you the trouble of looking it up):

- **Adds dice to the roll = attribute x 1** (i.e., usage and regeneration)    
- **Adds victories to the roll or reduces CL = attribute x 2** (i.e., simplification)    
- **Restores health points directly = attribute x 4** (i.e., healing)

> [!example]
> * Bandage, which has 3 uses and adds +1 die = cost 4
> * Injection, which reduces CL by 2 = cost 6
> * Ring of regeneration – heals 0.5 of an injury each night – this depends on whether the narrator counts 0.5x4 or 5x4.
> * Aura of slow healing - adds +2 dice to the regenerative roll, with "infinite" usage = cost 12

#### Treating Another Character

An injured character can be treated by someone else. The character who treats someone rolls the dice against CL 3:

- 3 Dice as a base    
- plus Skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]”    
- plus [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] focused on healing, without which the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]], or at a [[great disadvantage\|great disadvantage]] in the case of complex healing or deep wounds that need a specialized doctor.    
- plus dice for regenerative items

>[!warning]
When one character wants to treat another character with their spell, only the spell is rolled, according to the rules of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]].

An injured character can be treated with a skill (and talent) a maximum of once every 24 hours. The injured character can then heal themselves through natural regeneration (even if they were treated by another character). However, not immediately—maybe after 1 hour, or only at night.

As for the evaluation of regeneration, the same rules apply as mentioned above. The number of health points healed is equal to the number of victories rolled over the CL. The narrator can decide that for their story, it is better if the regeneration is slower. For example, instead of 1 health point, the character regenerates only 0.1. So, if there were 6 victories, it would mean 0.6.

#### Health Problem

In the story, things can happen that harm the character or complicate their life by causing a health problem. When this happens, the narrator first decides whether it will be a "life-threatening" or "annoying" problem. Then it is determined whether it is "acute" or "chronic." And then it is determined what is needed for the character to heal.

(Based on what is consumed during the health problem, we divide the problem into:)
- **Life-threatening** health problems give the character injury points. For example, for each round, they receive 1 injury point. The life threat can be significant (where they receive, for example, 2 or 3 injury points), and some injuries can be blocked by armor (for example, fire cannot be blocked by armor, but a strangling snake can be blocked).    
- **Annoying** health problems reduce the number of dice the character can roll. These are complications like blindness, difficulty walking, or difficulty breathing. An annoying health problem itself never reduces [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] (like poison, for example).

(Based on how quickly the health problem needs to be addressed, we divide the problem into:)
- **Acute** problems are those that need to be addressed here and now. For example, the character is _currently_ on fire, and if they do not extinguish it, they will lose [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]].    
- **Chronic** problems will bother the character longer, and their effect does not need to be addressed immediately (and cannot be addressed immediately here and now).

**Healing** or solving the problem depends on the problem itself. Therefore, the narrator must specify what the character must do to get rid of the problem. To mitigate the effects of either life-threatening or annoying problems, the skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]” is rolled against a challenge level set by the narrator. The minimum CL is 3.

The length of healing or solving the problem also depends on the problem. In the case of fire, it is enough if the character jumps into water (i.e., 1 round is enough to solve the problem). In the case that the character is poisoned, the poison's effect must be suppressed several times (for example, when the character suppresses the poison's effect 3 times, the poison disappears from their body). In the case that the character has a severed hand or heavy bleeding, they must save themselves with an item that stops bleeding (for example, using a tourniquet. In this case, the challenge level must be overcome to know if the solution to the problem is successful). The solution to the problem and its duration is determined by the narrator.

> [!example]
> 
> - Severe bleeding
> 	- Life-threatening problem, acute
> 	- The character loses 1 health point per round if the bleeding is not stopped.
> 	- To treat, a tourniquet must be used. Challenge level is 3. The character can roll only once per round.
> 
> - Burning (the character is on fire)
> 	- Life-threatening problem, acute
> 	- The character loses 2 health points per round if not extinguished.
> 	- To treat, water must be used (the character can jump into a river) – the character will be extinguished and will no longer lose health points in the next round.
> 	- If the character has no water, they can drop to the ground and try to extinguish themselves. They must roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] against a challenge level of 3. The character is extinguished only if they pass the challenge level. The character can roll only once per round.
> 
> - Frozen (the character is in a block of ice)
> 	- Life-threatening problem, acute
> 	- The character's health is reduced to 1 unless they thaw.
> 	- A heat source must be used for treatment. In the case of strong heat, the character will thaw in 3 rounds. In the case of weak heat, in 6 rounds.
> 
> - Slow poison (the character is poisoned)
> 	- Annoying problem, chronic.
> 	- The character feels unwell, has difficulty walking, and is dizzy. Their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] are reduced to minus 2.
> 	- Slow poison is part of a ritual and will naturally fade after 3 days.
> 	- The effect of the poison can be suppressed by rolling the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]], which is rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|an assist roll]].

### Points of Speed

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] determine the order in combat and also indicate how many items a character can carry in their inventory. The number of speed points is determined by the narrator. Unless specified otherwise, each character receives **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] of speed** (this applies to all characters, as well as monsters or animals).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] can be increased by items such as potions, magical amulets, exoskeletons, and so on. They are permanently increased when a player allocates a point to the reflex attribute ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]).

The minimum number of speed points is -2, at which point the character loses 2 dice from each roll (at -1, they lose 1 die).

#### Combat Order

More on this topic can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat chapter]]. But for completeness – [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] determine the order in which combat takes place. Combat consists of several phases – declaration of action (what the characters will do), execution of action (rolling dice and what happened), and combat result (who takes damage). [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] influence all combat phases.

During the declaration of action, players (and the narrator) state what their characters will do. Characters with the lowest speed (least [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed points]]) declare their actions first. Faster characters go next, and the fastest characters go last. This allows faster characters to react to what slower characters do. Slower characters cannot change their declared actions during the combat round.

> [!example]
> 
A player's character is fighting a bandit. The player's character has lower speed (fewer speed points) than the bandit. Let's say they are fighting in a tavern, and to gain a better combat position, the player wants to jump on a table. The bandit (with higher speed) decides to kick the table. The player cannot change their action since they already declared it.

In the next combat phase (execution of action), faster characters act first. They perform their planned actions before others. Whether they succeed is determined by rolling dice.

> [!example]
> 
The bandit kicks the table before the player can jump on it. (Dice rolls determine if the bandit succeeds.)

#### Other Uses of Speed Points

- When a character exhausts their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]], they can use 1 speed point to restore 3 inventory points.    
- Speed points can also be sacrificed, where 1 speed point grants the character 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]].

### Points of Energy

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]] talk about how many spells a character can cast. So, how many fire rays, how many healing touches, or how many protective shields.

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] of energy**. These can be increased by items such as crystals, or they can be increased when the character invests in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] attribute. In such cases, the character gains an additional [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]].

#### Energy Consumption

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]] serve as a reservoir. After each spell, its energy points are reduced. When the energy points drop to 0, the character will use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] instead of energy points. The cost of spells, for both types of points, is determined by category (see below).

##### Small Useful Spells

**These are**: Lighting a candle, lighting a campfire, cooling beer, healing very small wounds (like a knife cut).

**Consumption**: These spells consume no energy.

##### Common Useful Spells

**These are**: All [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spells except small and large ones.

**Consumption**: 1 spell consumes 1 energy point.

##### Large Useful Spells

**These are**:
- Large spells that act at a distance of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Distance\|Further 10m - 100m]] and beyond.    
    - (For example, a healing spell that heals characters within a 300m radius)        
- Or any spell the narrator deems too powerful.    
    - (For example, a spell that restores all health points of a character, or one that creates an elemental golem)     

**Consumption**: 1 spell consumes 2 energy points, or even 3, as determined by the narrator.

##### Combat Spells or Shield or Armor

**These are**: All combat spells, or spells that function as a magical shield, or spells that add armor, or any other combat advantage.

**Spell Consumption by Weapon Type**:
- 1 small weapon type spell consumes 1 energy point    
- 1 medium weapon type spell consumes 2 energy points    
- 1 large weapon type spell consumes 3 energy points    

**Armor Consumption**:
- 1 light armor consumes 1 energy point    
- 1 medium armor consumes 2 energy points    
- 1 heavy weapon consumes 3 energy points

>[!note]
Note When the type of combat spell cannot be determined, the spell consumes 2 energy points.

### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]] do not exist by themselves; it's just a name for the game mechanic where a character sacrifices their item, health, money, or anything they own to gain wins for their roll.

> [!example]
>
>Characters are being chased by a dragon. They ended up in a dead end. However, there is a locked door. One of the characters has a big hammer (as a weapon) and could smash the door.
>
>Let's say they have 7 dice to roll and need to beat a difficulty level of 4 because the door is sturdy.
>
>Let's say the character managed to roll 3 wins, which is not enough. Therefore, they decide to sacrifice some of the weapon's attributes, gaining the one win they need. Thanks to that, they break the door.

A sacrifice can only be used for logically applicable things, and each use must be approved by the narrator. Sacrifice can only be used by [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Main Hero\|main characters]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Main Enemy\|main enemies]].

#### Earning Sacrifice Points

A character earns [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]] by sacrificing some attribute either from their body (e.g., health) or from their item (e.g., attack). These points are then converted into wins that they can use in their roll.

- **Sacrificing an Attribute That Adds Dice to the Roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]])**    
    - Attributes that can be sacrificed:        
        - Attributes from an item that add dice to skills, talents, and specializations (not dice for attack)            
    - Attributes that cannot be sacrificed:        
        - Skills, talents, and specializations from the character            
    - The character receives:        
        - 1 win for 1 point of the sacrificed attribute            
- **Sacrificing an Attribute Used in Combat**    
    - Attributes that can be sacrificed:        
        - An attribute from an item that adds dice to attack, increases [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Weapon Attributes\|max damage]], or adds armor         
    - Attributes that cannot be sacrificed:        
        - Combat talents and specializations from the character            
    - The character receives:        
        - 2 wins for 1 point of the sacrificed attribute            
- **Sacrificing an Attribute That Improves Passive Characteristics or Other Points**    
    - Attributes that can be sacrificed:        
        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]            
    - Attributes that cannot be sacrificed:        
        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Weight of Inventory\|Weight of Inventory]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]]            
    - The character receives:        
        - 4 wins for 1 point of the sacrificed attribute

##### Note on Health Sacrifice

When sacrificing health, the character may receive additional conditions, such as a broken arm or bleeding. However, this depends on the narrator. Injuries caused by health sacrifice require double the healing points for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health\|recovery]].

##### Note on Item Sacrifice

When an entire item is sacrificed, or when an item has exhausted all attributes that could be sacrificed, the item can no longer be repaired. If the item is only damaged because the character used some of its points, it can be repaired, but only by a specialist (e.g., a blacksmith repairs a sword). The final repair cost is increased by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Negotiating Prices with a Merchant\|merchant's surcharge]], where the narrator rolls three dice and the resulting value is added to the repair cost. Alternatively, the repair may require a rare component that the character must find.

##### Note on Wealth Sacrifice

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] can only be sacrificed when social skills are rolled. For every 10 wealth points, the character gains 1 win in their roll. The same applies to combat (where wealth points can be used to persuade the enemy to stop fighting), but in this case, the number of points to be sacrificed is determined by the narrator.

Alternatively, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] can be sacrificed by purchasing a service (e.g., hiring a locksmith to open a chest), or by hiring a companion to help solve a problem, or by purchasing a blacksmith's services to repair armor, or finally, to replenish points that the character has used (e.g., renting a room at an inn to sleep and replenish [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]).

##### Note on Sacrificing the Entire Character

If there is no other option and the dice roll is too important for the survival of the entire group, a player can decide to sacrifice their entire character. This will win the dice roll, solving the problem completely and entirely. However, the character will be permanently out of the game and cannot be revived in any way.

> [!example]
> 
> Let's say the players are being chased by a dragon. They ended up in a dead end with wooden doors. One of the players has a big hammer as a weapon and there is a possibility they could smash the doors.
> 
> Let's say they have 7 dice to roll against a difficulty level of 4 (sturdy doors). They fail to roll any wins. Let's say their character is injured and decides to sacrifice themselves.
> 
> Narratively, the narrator can describe that the character smashed into the doors, causing them to open. However, the wall weakened and the ceiling started to collapse. The other players escaped while the injured character stayed behind to stop the dragon. Both the character and the dragon were buried under the rubble, and after this sacrifice, the dragon will no longer pose a threat to the players.

#### Restoration of Sacrificed Attribute Points

Sacrificed attribute points of the character are considered an injury and are restored in the same way as an injury (see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 03 - Points#Note on Health Sacrifice\|health sacrifice]]). However, twice the healing points are needed for recovery.

#### Use of Sacrifice Points

Sacrifice points can only be used to gain a win in the character's roll. The cost of sacrifice depends on whether the character wants to match their wins to the difficulty level, or exceed it (i.e., achieve more wins than the CL). If the character wants to match the wins to the CL, 1 win point requires 1 sacrifice point, while in the second case (exceeding the CL), 1 win point requires 2 sacrifice points.

> [!example]  Example (matching wins)
> - The character rolled 3 wins.
> - The difficulty level is 5, so they need 2 more wins.
> - If they only want to match the 2 wins, they "pay" 2 sacrifice points.

>[!example] Example (exceeding the CL)
>- The character rolled 5 wins.
>- The difficulty level is 5, but the character wants 1 additional win, for example, to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Negotiating Prices with a Merchant\|persuade a merchant]] to give them a discount.
>- In that case, they "pay" 2 sacrifice points for 1 win.

### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] refer to the amount of money a character carries. The number is determined by the narrator, and unless stated otherwise, every character receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6]]0 wealth points at the beginning of the game. These points can be increased when the character invests in the attribute [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] and can further be increased by selling, stealing, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward\|completing tasks]].

#### How much money should the character receive?

At the beginning of the story, each character receives a certain amount of money. Below is a list of wealth levels. The narrator determines the character's wealth level according to this list.

- Homeless: (0 - 10)
- Low-income: (11 - 20)
- Average income: (21 - 40)
- Good income: (41 - 80)
- Upper class: (81 - 160)
- High class: (161 - 320)
- Wealthier: (321 - 640)
- Rich: (641 - 1,280)
- Very rich: (1,281 - 2,560)
- Extra rich: (2,561 - 5,120)

If the narrator can't decide how much money a character should receive, they can roll dice, for example, when characters meet a wandering merchant. The number rolled on the dice is multiplied by 10 to determine how much money the other character (such as the wandering merchant) has. If it’s a very wealthy character, the narrator can roll multiple dice.

#### Consumption of wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] (p.w.) in our system are considered as money, such as euros, coins, credits. This is because they are spent in the same way as those mentioned euros, coins, credits. So if something costs, for example, 10 p.w. and the character has 30 p.w. in their pockets, after purchasing the item, the character will have only 20 p.w. left.

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

##### For Example

> [!example]
>- Leather armor, which adds 3 points of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor\|armor]] -> price 6
>- Long axe, which increases max damage by 2 -> price 4
>-  Bandage, which adds 3 dice to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Liečenie zranenia\|natural regeneration]] -> price 3
>- Healing potion, which immediately adds 2 health points -> price 8

##### Quality and Price

If the narrator wants, they can adjust the final price according to the quality or rarity. If the item is rare or of higher quality, the price increases. And if the item is damaged, or is something abundant (like sand in the desert), the price decreases.

- Trash - 16 p.w.
- Horrible / Damaged - 8 p.w.
- Bad / Very abundant item - 4 p.w.
- Worse / Abundant item - 2 p.w.
- Normal + 0 p.w. (base for all items)
- Better / Unusual + 2 p.w.
- Quality / Exceptional + 4 p.w.
- Good / Rare + 8 p.w.
- Very rare + 16 p.w.

##### Merchant Markup

The final price can also be increased by the merchant's markup. To determine it, one, two, or three dice are used (depending on how much the merchant wants to earn). The narrator rolls the dice and the value rolled:

- is added up and added to the final price of the item (when the character buys from the merchant),
- or subtracted from the final price (when the character sells something to the merchant).

#### Price in the Story

When a character wants to buy a room in a hotel, sell a car, or buy a beer—how much will they pay? The narrator can decide how to proceed.

##### First Option

The first option is that the price of an item or service is determined by the number of points (dice, or attributes) a character receives. For example, when a character rents a room in a hotel, they do so to rest and thus restore their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. The price will reflect the number of points the character restores. If it is an item that brings some benefit to the character (for example, a nice shirt adds dice to the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] skill), the number of points (or dice) the item brings to the character determines the final price.

##### Second Option

The second option is that the price is determined according to the scale:

- Cheap: 1 - 5
- Common: 5 - 9
- Pricier: 10 - 14
- Expensive: 15 - 19
- and so on

##### Third Option

The third option is that the narrator looks up the price of an item in our real world, divides it by 30, and rounds up. The minimum price of an item is always 1 p.w.

>[!example]
>A new car costs 22,000 €, so the price should be around 733 p.w.

Of course, the same applies as above. If an item or service is rare (or common) in the given world, the narrator can adjust the price of the service (see section [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 03 - Points#Quality and Price\|Quality and Price]]).

#### Earning points of Wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] increase when a character sells something, completes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Body za splnenie príbehovej úlohy\|a task]], receives a reward for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Prvá možnosť Body podľa úrovne nepriateľov\|defeating an enemy]], or performs a job. They receive their money directly from other characters. The money is added just like during consumption. So if a character has 20 p.w. and sells an item for 30, they will have 50 p.w.

#### Negotiating Prices with a Merchant

The price of an item in a shop can be lowered or increased in favor of the character. To do this, any [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used, rolled as an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active conflict]] against any of the merchant's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute. The price with the merchant can also be changed through simple conversation, or the character can solve the merchant's problem.

If a character decides they want to negotiate the price with the merchant, they choose the skill they will use (any from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used) and state how much they want to adjust the price in their favor (e.g., lower the price when buying, or increase the price when selling). For each point the character changes their price, the merchant gets that many wins added to their roll. This number is divided by 2.

> [!example] 
> For example, a character wants to change the price (in their favor) by 
> 
> 1 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 2 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 3 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 4 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 5 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 6 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 
> and so on

> [!example]
> - A character wants to buy an axe that costs 6.
> - The character wants to lower the price by 4 points.
> - The merchant gets 2 wins in their roll.

- When the price negotiation is won by the character, the price is adjusted by the amount they wanted.
- When the price negotiation is won by the merchant, the price is adjusted unfavorably for the character by the number of additional wins the merchant rolled. These wins are then multiplied by 5.

> [!example] (...continuing from the previous example)
> - The character rolled 4 wins
> - The merchant rolled 3 wins + 2 that they received
> - The merchant, therefore, rolled 1 more win than the character
> <br>
> - If the character wanted to buy the item, its price increases by 5 points
> - If the character wanted to sell the item, its price decreases by 5 points

Price negotiation can only be rolled once.

### Points of Reward

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] do not exist by themselves; it's a game mechanic through which a character receives a reward for defeating a group of enemies, completing a task, or for a player playing their character very well (like a good actor). These points are used to increase [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]], increase [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]], restore other points that the character previously used up (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]], etc.), or to obtain an item.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] are always given by the narrator and the player should use them as soon as possible.

The reward points rule applies only to characters controlled by players. Other characters controlled by the narrator do not receive any rewards.

#### Points for Combat

A character earns [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] when they defeat or kill an enemy or a group of enemies. Additionally, they can earn extra points for defeating special characters or completing special tasks.

>[!note]
>Defeating an enemy also means: knocking them out, forcing them to flee, or making them stop fighting. It doesn't have to be just killing.

Regarding defeating an enemy, the narrator has four options for setting the reward for characters. This can be either by the level of the enemy, the type of enemy character, the size of the group (of enemies), or the strength of the group (of enemies).

##### First Option: Points Based on Enemy Level

The narrator can use a luck die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter#Množstvo atribútov pre nepriateľa\|determine the strength of the enemies]] that attacked the characters. This strength of the enemies also determines the amount of reward when the characters defeat them.

All characters receive this reward after the battle and in the same amount (the reward is not divided).

- Level 1 = +2 reward points (number 6 on the luck die)    
- Level 2 = +4 reward points (number 5 on the luck die)    
- Level 3 = +6 reward points (number 4 on the luck die)    
- Level 4 = +8 reward points (number 3 on the luck die)    
- Level 5 = +10 reward points (number 2 on the luck die)    
- Level 6 = +12 reward points (number 1 on the luck die)

##### Second Option: Points Based on Enemy Type

Characters receive this reward as soon as they defeat (or kill) the enemy. However, if they wish, they can receive it at the end of the battle. The fate of the reward is decided by the narrator. The narrator can decide that the reward goes only to the character who killed the enemy, or that the reward is shared equally among all characters.

- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Extras\|Extras]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Unimportant Character\|Minor Character]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Supporting Character\|Supporting Character]] = +4 reward points for defeating or killing.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Important Character\|Important Enemy]] = +10 reward points for defeating, +20 reward points for killing.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Main Hero\|Main Enemy]] = +30 reward points for defeating, +60 reward points for killing.    
- Enemy [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/character in general/RPG - Groups of characters#Divine Character\|Divine Characters]] = +120 reward points for defeating.

##### Third Option: Points Based on Group Size

All characters receive this reward after the battle and in the same amount (the reward is not divided).

- One or two enemies: +4 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Small group of enemies: +8 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Large group of enemies: +16 reward points for defeating or killing

##### Fourth Option: Points Based on Enemy Group Strength

All characters receive this reward after the battle and in the same amount (the reward is not divided).

- Weak enemy: +4 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Average enemy: +8 reward points for defeating or killing    
- Strong enemy: +16 reward points for defeating or killing

##### Special Task

During combat, a character can receive a special task that they may or may not complete. For example, an enemy attacks a villager and tries to kidnap them, or an entrance to a building needs to be barricaded. These tasks are optional and not crucial for the “main” battle taking place but can help the villagers. Completing such a task rewards the player with reward points equal to the difficulty level of the task or based on the level of the enemy they had to defeat.

If a character performs a heroic deed during combat or accomplishes something incredible, they can also receive reward points. In this case, the number of points is determined by the difficulty level of the task, but the narrator can increase the total number of points.

##### Group Points Division

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] for combat are given to the entire group in full. This means the points are not divided among the players. For example, if a player is to receive 4 points for combat, each player in the group who participated in the battle also receives 4 points. An exception is the completion of a special task or heroic deed, or (if the narrator decides) the killing of a special enemy. In this case, the points are given to the player(s) who completed the special task during the battle.

#### Points for Completing Story Tasks

Characters can earn 1 full point from the narrator, which they can allocate to any Skill (talent, or specialization). However, the narrator may decide to give the characters another reward for completing a side story task or meeting special conditions of the main story task.

> [!example]
> The players must bring back a spy. Alive or dead. They receive a smaller reward for a dead spy, but it will be easier, while a live spy gives them triple the reward but is much more challenging.

The narrator determines the reward amount for each completed condition in the story task or for each completed side task. The following list can be used:

- Simple task: 3 points    
- Moderately difficult task: 6 points    
- Difficult task: 12 points

The narrator may also decide that characters receive points for completing side (optional or special) tasks based on the difficulty level of the task. If the task involves multiple dice rolls with multiple DLs, the narrator selects only the highest DL (or can decide to sum up all DLs). In that case, the reward would look like this:

- DL 3 = +9 reward points    
- DL 4 = +12 reward points    
- DL 5 = +15 reward points    
- DL 6 = +18 reward points    
- DL 7 = +21 reward points    
- DL 8 = +24 reward points    
- (DL x 3)

##### Main Task

The main task is something that players must accomplish. It is their primary goal. It spans multiple sessions and mainly several story days (it can involve story months or even years).

> [!example] 
>The characters must break into a magical bank. They want to steal a valuable artifact from there. The problem is that it's the most guarded city in the entire country, with many battle-hardened mages, numerous traps, and who knows what else. Moreover, the artifact is in a magical vault that not just anyone can open. The characters don't even know exactly where the artifact is. So, to complete the main task, they must gather all the information, accumulate resources, perhaps hire someone, and devise a foolproof plan.

The main task can be likened to a story from a book. It's something that unfolds throughout the entire novel.

##### Side Task

Alongside the Main Task, side tasks that relate to the main one may arise. A side task should not last more than three RPG sessions or more than a story month. A side task can address part of the Main Task or be something entirely outside the main story.

> [!example] 
> The players need to break into a magical bank with many magical vaults. However, they need a potion from the Alchemist. The Alchemist gives them a task before starting the potion. For example, the players must raid a bandit camp (partly because the Alchemist was attacked and robbed by the bandits, and partly because the camp contains ingredients for the potion). The bandit camp is quite large, so the players must plan the best way in and out.

> [!example] 
> (outside the main storyline)
> The players are awakened at night by ominous sounds. They discover that the village is haunted at night. They decide to (accept the side task from the local mayor and) cleanse the village of spirits.

A side task can be likened to a chapter in a book. It is something addressed over several pages, after which another issue is tackled.

#### Points for Fulfilling a Desire

Every character has something they desire, wants to achieve, or atone for. It can be something small or something very significant that they struggle with throughout their life. For fulfilling this desire, the character receives reward points based on the difficulty level of the given desire.

- DL 3 = +9 reward points    
- DL 4 = +12 reward points    
- DL 5 = +15 reward points    
- DL 6 = +18 reward points    
- DL 7 = +21 reward points    
- DL 8 = +24 reward points    
- (DL x 3)

> [!example]
> A character wants to quit smoking. This is a very difficult task requiring a lot of effort, with a DL of 5. When the character successfully quits smoking, they receive 15 reward points.

#### Points for Good Role-Playing

When a player portrays their character very well, like an actor in a movie, and does everything the character would do, even if it harms the character – the narrator can decide to reward the player. As a reward, they can give 4 reward points (or 8 for exceptional role-playing. Each level is in multiples of 4).

#### Points for Treasure

Characters can also earn [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] when they find treasure, gems, or something truly valuable. The narrator can decide whether the characters receive wealth points or an item. The number of points that the character (or their group) receives is based on the level of the treasure. This number can be multiplied by its size.

- Points based on treasure level:    
    - Level 0 = +2 reward points (Worthless) (number 1 on the luck die)        
    - Level 1 = +4 reward points (Common) (number 2 on the luck die)        
    - Level 2 = +6 reward points (Uncommon) (number 3 on the luck die)       
    - Level 3 = +8 reward points (Exceptional) (number 4 on the luck die)       
    - Level 4 = +10 reward points (Rare) (number 5 on the luck die)        
    - Level 5 = +12 reward points (Very Rare) (number 6 on the luck die)        
- Points based on treasure size:    
    - x 1 (Common size – the treasure fits into a small chest)        
    - x 2 (Uncommon size – the treasure fits into a closet)        
    - x 3 (Exceptional size – the treasure fits into a room)        
    - x 4 (Large treasure – the treasure fits into a house)        
    - x 5 (Very large treasure – the treasure is as extensive as a valley)

#### Use of Reward Points

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]] are converted into other character points, which the player records in their table. This conversion must happen as soon as possible. If the player does not use the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]], they will be lost. (Conversion at the end of a combat encounter is sufficient.)

- _For 1 reward point, the character receives_    
    - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Wealth Points]], where the character receives 1 wealth point for 1 reward point.        
    - A useful item based on [[RPG - Item Points\|item points]], where the character receives 1 useful die for 1 reward point.        
- _For 2 reward points, the character receives_ (total points divided by 2)    
    - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]], where the character receives 1 training point for 2 reward points.        
    - A weapon based on [[RPG - Item Points\|item points]], where the character receives 1 attack point for 2 reward points.        
    - Ammunition replenishment, 1 piece for 2 reward points.        
    - Armor based on [[RPG - Item Points\|item points]], where the character receives 1 armor point for 2 reward points.        
- _For 4 reward points, the character receives_ (total points divided by 4)    
    - Restoration of 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]]        
    - Restoration of 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed point]]        
    - Restoration of 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|energy point]]

The player can allocate their points to multiple categories. They do not have to "purchase" from only one category, as long as they have enough reward points. If the player is short on reward points, the narrator decides what happens.

### Points of Items

The character can create any item, provided they have the talent, sufficient materials, and the necessary tools. The character must specify exactly what they want to create. The narrator will then specify the materials needed, the tools required, and whether dice will be rolled once or multiple times, as well as how many story hours the creation of the item will take.

The skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" or "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]" is used to create the item. Other skills can also be used for the creation of the item, but only as an "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|supporting roll]]" (e.g., the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" when forging a sword)

> [!note] Skills and Item Creation
> **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]** is used for creating items that only require knowledge and skilled hands, but not complex machines. Examples include brewing potions, embroidering magical runes into cloth, creating a statue (which a magician later animates), stringing beads (to make a magical necklace), forging a sword, making a bow, and so on.
> 
> **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]** are rolled when the character is creating a machine or using a machine to create an item (e.g., a replicator that makes medicine, a CNC machine that cuts a knife from a piece of steel, an analytical mixer that mixes a potion).
>
> So if, for example, a blacksmith wanted to make a sword and used a machine for it, such as a computer-controlled lathe (or something similarly complex), then " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]" would be rolled because the machine needs to be programmed. If the blacksmith used their hands to make the sword, " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" would be rolled (in this case, " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" could also be rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|supporting roll]]).

#### Challenge Level for Creating an Item

The character specifies what they want to create and what attributes the item should have. Based on this, the difficulty level is calculated according to the following list:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/04-points/rpg-points-of-wealth/#item-price" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.


</div></div>


The difficulty level can be adjusted by the narrator if the character is making a complex item or if they have weak tools or are missing a minor component (e.g., one clip instead of two). Better auxiliary items like a modern blacksmith's forge (instead of a regular forge), a higher-quality hammer, etc., reduce the difficulty level. The amount of reduction is determined by the narrator.

After rolling the dice, all wins are summed. If the number of wins is lower, the item is created with worse attributes or no item is created at all, and the materials are destroyed.

##### Bonus Points for Items

A character can earn additional wins if they use higher quality or rarer materials (e.g., using titanium instead of iron) or if they enhance their basic materials (e.g., creating a purer alloy).

> [!example]
>  - The character is going to make an axe.
>  - They are a blacksmith and have all the materials. Some materials have also been enhanced.
>- They rolled [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] "blacksmith" +[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]+[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]]+3
>- Against a difficulty level of 3 and achieved, say, 6 wins.
>- This grants them 3 item points.
>- Enhanced materials provide, say, 4 wins (iron bar 2, better wood 1, better axe handle 1)
>- Thus, the character gains a total of 7 wins.

Regarding rare materials, the narrator determines how many wins they add to the final result.

For enhanced materials, the character must enhance them themselves (e.g., by refining steel) or buy them from a merchant. Enhancing materials (which must be approved by the narrator) is done in the same way as a roll for creating an item. Because it involves creating a better material, the difficulty level may be higher or lower, depending on the circumstances and tools used.

#### Crafting with a Blacksmith

A character can have an item created by a blacksmith (or another specialist). This option works the same as "normal" item creation, with the difference that attributes are paid for with money. In addition to this amount, the blacksmith's fee and the cost of materials that the blacksmith must purchase to create the item are added.

#### Item Enhancement

This involves improving a property or increasing an attribute of an item. A character can enhance an item only if allowed by the narrator and if they have the necessary [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] that can be used for creating or enhancing items, such as a blacksmith or an herbalist.

Enhancing an item is done in the same way as creating a new item. The character specifies what they want to enhance and by how much. To enhance an item, the character needs components. Not raw materials, but actual parts or components that can be replaced or installed in the item. (Necessary components can be created from raw materials.) If the character has everything needed, the tools, or access to a suitable workshop, they can start the enhancement, which can be completed within two hours. It is important to note that item enhancement is irreversible, and the player might even damage their item.

In this case, the skill " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" or " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]" is used. Other skills can be used only as " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Self-assistance\|supporting rolls]]" (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]] " [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" when forging a sword).

The difficulty level is determined in the same way as for item creation. However, the "strength" of the component (i.e., the number of points it adds to the item) is considered the CL.

> [!example] 
> The character wants to enhance an axe. They have a handle that adds +3 dice to attack. The CL for enhancement will be 6.

As with item creation, the CL for enhancement can be influenced by tools, the workshop, and other circumstances (e.g., if the character is in a hurry).

#### Item Repair

If a character finds a damaged item or damages an item themselves, they have the option to repair it. The narrator determines whether the player can repair the item and what components are needed. It is important to note that items that have been [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Sacrifice\|sacrificed]] or deliberately destroyed cannot be repaired. A character can repair an item only if they have the relevant talent logically associated with repairing that item (such as a blacksmith). It is crucial to remember that once a player decides to repair their item, this action is irreversible. There is a risk that the player may damage the item further.

Item repair is carried out in the same way as creating a new item or enhancing an old one. The CL for repair is calculated the same way as when creating the item (i.e., the number of points and type determine the final CL - see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 03 - Points#Challenge Level for Creating an Item\|above]] under "Challenge Level for Creating an Item").

##### What is a Damaged Item?

A damaged item is one whose natural attributes are reduced due to improper use, heavy attack, or unfortunate accident. Despite the reduced attributes, such an item can still be used; however, only its reduced attributes are considered when rolling dice.

If an item's natural attributes are "exhausted," it is considered destroyed and can no longer be used. The weight of a damaged or destroyed item remains the same as for a regular item.

### Points of Inventory

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] talk about how many items a character can carry. This includes holding in hands, wearing, putting on the back, or putting on feet.

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] of inventory**. These can be increased by items such as a backpack, or they can be increased when the character invests in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] attribute or sacrifices 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|point of speed]]. In each case (whether investing in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] or sacrificing a point of speed), the character gains an additional [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] inventory points.

The inventory rule applies only to characters controlled by players. The remaining characters controlled by the narrator have no inventory limitations.

#### Inventory Consumption

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] serve as a limit, indicating how many items a character can carry.

##### Small Items

**These are**: Rings, amulets, herb bundles, vials

**Consumption**: These items do not consume any inventory points.

However, when a character has 10 small items on them, such a "bundle" will consume 1 inventory point.

##### Common Items

**These are**: Any item that is not heavy or large (see below)

**Consumption**: 1 item consumes 1 inventory point.

##### Large or Heavy Items

**These are**:
- A large item is almost as large as the character (approx. 150 cm)    
- A heavy item is almost as heavy as the character (approx. 40 kg)    

**Consumption**: 1 item consumes 2 or 3 inventory points.

##### Weapon or Shield or Armor

**These are**: Weapons, Shields, or Armor that a character has ready for combat. That is - they are not stored in a backpack, but are in hand or somewhere on the body.

**Weapon Consumption**:
- 1-2 small weapons consume 1 inventory point    
- 1 medium weapon consumes 2 inventory points    
- 1 large weapon consumes 3 inventory points    

**Armor Consumption**:
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|light armor]] consumes 1 inventory point    
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|medium armor]] consumes 2 inventory points    
- 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor#Types of Armor\|heavy weapon]] consumes 3 inventory points    

>[!note] 
>Note When the type of weapon or armor cannot be determined, the item consumes 2 inventory points.

#### Other Rules for Inventory Consumption

There are other ways to calculate inventory consumption. The narrator can decide which method to use, or whether to combine some methods.

##### By Weight

By weight, the inventory is calculated such that for each 1 kg of weight (or 1 meter of length) - 0.2 inventory points are consumed. This method is more suitable for realistic games, or games where survival is key (e.g., zombie apocalypse).

Conversion Table:

| ==Kg== | p.i | ==Kg== | p.i | ==Kg== | p.i | ==Kg== | p.i |
| :----: | :-: | :----: | :-: | :----: | :-: | :----: | :-: |
|   1    | 0.2 |   11   | 2.2 |   21   | 4.2 |   31   | 6.2 |
|   2    | 0.4 |   12   | 2.4 |   22   | 4.4 |   32   | 6.4 |
|   3    | 0.6 |   13   | 2.6 |   23   | 4.6 |   33   | 6.6 |
|   4    | 0.8 |   14   | 2.8 |   24   | 4.8 |   34   | 6.8 |
|   5    |  1  |   15   |  3  |   25   |  5  |   35   |  7  |
|   6    | 1.2 |   16   | 3.2 |   26   | 5.2 |   36   | 7.2 |
|   7    | 1.4 |   17   | 3.4 |   27   | 5.4 |   37   | 7.4 |
|   8    | 1.6 |   18   | 3.6 |   28   | 5.6 |   38   | 7.6 |
|   9    | 1.8 |   19   | 3.8 |   29   | 5.8 |   39   | 7.8 |
|   10   |  2  |   20   |  4  |   30   |  6  |   40   |  8  |
(p.i. = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] )

##### By Item Bundles

Inventory consumption can also be calculated according to certain “bundles” of items, where the impact of the item on inventory is determined by its category. These are:

###### Bundle of Natural Items

**Impact on Inventory**: No impact on inventory

**Description**: This "bundle of items" has no impact on the inventory. These are "things" that have grown on the character, such as cat claws, turtle shells, or tentacles. These species-specific "things" have their advantages, but they must also have disadvantages. (For example, a turtle shell increases natural armor by +3, but reduces [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] by -1)

###### Bundle of Basic Items

**Impact on Inventory**: minus 1 point per bundle

**Description**:

- A bundle of basic items does not include all items in the world, but only those that enable the character to perform an activity.    
- The bundle's name should reflect its contents – e.g., adventurer's bundle, herbalist's bundle, wizard's bundle, traveling doctor's bundle, etc.    
    - An adventurer's bundle might contain a sleeping bag, travel food, a torch, a small axe (for chopping wood), and so on. So, whenever the character needs to, for example, sleep in the forest, they simply "take out" the sleeping bag from the bundle.        
- Each bundle's contents must be approved by the narrator. The narrator should determine which activities the bundle covers. Each world is different, and in each world, "basic" needs are considered differently.
    

**Advantages**:
- Can contain a very large number of items of a certain type.    

**Disadvantages**:
- Items from the bundle do not add any dice to rolls.    
- Items from the bundle can only be used to solve problems.    
- In combat, items can be used only in truly exceptional cases, with the roll result being the deflection of the enemy's attack.    
- The narrator may decide that some items are received only when the character rolls a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|luck die]] (this is described below under the heading [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 03 - Points#Luck Roll When Searching for Items\|#Luck Roll When Searching for Items]]).    
- Additional restrictions depend on the game's genre. In some games, the bundle may have an infinite number of uses. In other games, e.g., in a zombie apocalypse, it may be limited to a certain number of uses, and its weight may also be higher.    

**Cost of a Basic Bundle**: (for a zombie apocalypse)
- Cheap bundle with a single item    
    - For example, just 1 bread, 1 water, and 1 bandage.        
    - Cost 1 - 4, weight 1.        
- Common bundle with multiple items    
    - For example, 4x bread, 4x water, and 4x bandage.        
    - Cost 5 - 9, weight 2.        
- Expensive bundle with a large number of items    
    - For example, 10x bread, 10x water, and 10x bandage.        
    - Cost 10 - 14, weight 3.

###### Bundle of Special Items

**Impact on Inventory**: minus 1 point, maximum of 10 items or 10 kg.

**Description**:
- This is a bundle of items that allow the character to perform an activity while also providing dice for rolls or benefits.    
- Items in this bundle are listed individually, item by item – hence it is more of a list of things.    
    - For example, a bundle might include: Belt of Strength, Ring of Healing, Glasses of Perception, and so on.        
- In addition to useful items, the list can include damaging items (e.g., grenades) or items with a single purpose and one-time use (e.g., 1x teleportation scroll).    

**Advantages**:
- Items from this bundle can add dice, benefits, and attributes.    
- Items can be used in combat without limitation.    

**Disadvantages**:
- This bundle uses 1 point even when it is not full. So, even 1 item uses up 1 whole point.    
- The number of items that can fit in the bundle is limited to 10 items or 10 kg. So, if the character has two items, each weighing 5 kg, the bundle is considered full.    
- Exceeding the weight or item limit deducts another point of speed from the character, thereby creating another bundle.

###### Weapon

**Impact on Inventory**: 1 point per 2 attack points. (That is = Weapon attack divided by 2, rounded up)

**Description**:
- When a character has a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]] in hand, it loses 1 point of speed for every 2 attack points.    
- When the weapon is stored in the inventory, it is considered a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 03 - Points#Stored Item\|stored item]] and falls under the category of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 03 - Points#Bundle of Special Items\|bundle of special items]].

###### Armor

**Impact on Inventory**: 1 point per 2 armor points (That is = Armor divided by 2, rounded up)

**Description**:
- When a character has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor\|armor]] equipped, it loses 1 point of speed for every 2 armor points.
- When the armor is stored in the inventory, it is considered a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 03 - Points#Stored Item\|stored item]] and falls under the category of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 03 - Points#Bundle of Special Items\|bundle of special items]].

#### Backpack

A character can change the impact of inventory by purchasing a backpack. It adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]]. Alternatively, the character can purchase something like an exoskeleton. In that case, the character gains [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] (which can be exchanged for inventory).

These special items must specify how they change the impact on inventory and by how many points.

In any case, *the change in inventory weight* and *adding speed points* is considered an attribute, priced at 4 points for 1 point.

Backpack or exoskeleton themselves do not have any impact on inventory as items (it's as if they weigh nothing).

##### Stored Item

Only the items that the character has on them (in hand, on foot, or in a place where the item is readily accessible, e.g., bandits with a sword at their belt) are counted towards the character's attributes (such as attack, armor, inventory, etc.).

Items that are stored in a backpack, on a horse, in a treasury, on a ship, etc., are not counted towards the character's attributes.

The character is burdened by the item's weight only when it is on their body or in their backpack. When a character stores an item outside their body, e.g., places it in a bag on a horse, the item no longer burdens the character with its weight. Such an item is called a "stored" item.

This advantage, however, comes with a drawback. If the character wants to use their stored item as quickly as possible, e.g., during combat, they must be near the place where they store their items. Retrieving a stored item takes 2 rounds. If the character wants to use a weapon immediately, they must roll an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] skill check against a difficulty level of 3. If they fail to meet this difficulty level, they cannot use the item in that round. Moreover, the number of rounds it takes for the character to retrieve the stored item to use it is equal to how much they missed the difficulty level by.

##### Dropping the Backpack

A character carrying heavy items or bundles in their inventory may lose speed points and possibly dice in rolls. If the character encounters a dangerous situation and wants to react immediately with full strength, they can drop their heavy backpack.

When the character drops the heavy backpack, all the negative effects are nullified. (The character can only drop the entire backpack – meaning all the items in it.)

To drop a heavy backpack, the character must wait 1-2 rounds (depending on the number of items and the complexity of their binding), or roll an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] skill check against a difficulty level of 3. If they succeed, they can react immediately in that round. The number of rounds it takes to discard the excess load equals how much they missed the difficulty level by. The player cannot roll again to drop the heavy inventory.

Naturally, if the character does not have the heavy backpack on, they cannot use the items in it. The narrator decides on the possibility of using items from a dropped backpack.

#### New or Forgotten Items

When it comes to items that were not considered when creating the character (e.g., whether a climber has pitons and carabiners for securing a rope), or items the player wishes to have (e.g., wants to throw a jug of water at the enemy), or items the player has already used but needs more of (e.g., more ammunition) - the so-called [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] is used to determine if the character has such an item (or rather, if the character has found such an item). If the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] is successful, the character finds the item and can use it. If the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] is unsuccessful, the character does not find the item or finds an item that further complicates the situation.

##### Result of the Luck Roll When Searching for Items

The character is looking for something:

1. Huge Misfortune    
    - Either the character does not find the item.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but using it increases the difficulty level by plus 2 because it is broken.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but to use it, they must solve a problem at difficulty level 3.        
    - Or the character must assemble or activate the item. Assembling or activating it will also have a difficulty level of 3.        
2. Great Misfortune    
    - Either the character does not find the item.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but using it increases the difficulty level by plus 1 because it is somewhat broken.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but to use it, they must solve a problem at difficulty level 2.        
    - Or the character must assemble or activate the item. Assembling or activating it will also have a difficulty level of 2.        
3. Slight Misfortune    
    - The character finds the item, but to use it, they must solve a problem at difficulty level 1.        
    - Or the character must assemble or activate the item. Assembling or activating it will also have a difficulty level of 1.        
4. Slight Fortune    
    - The character finds the item and can use it immediately.        
5. Great Fortune    
    - The character finds the item and can use it immediately. This item reduces the difficulty level by 1 or adds 1 win to the roll.        
6. Huge Fortune    
    - The character finds the item and can use it immediately. This item reduces the difficulty level by 2 or adds 2 wins to the roll.

### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]] are used to permanently improve a character's attributes. Such improvement can only be gained through training (like lifting weights, running around the village, or hitting a target). A character can train any passive Attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]), [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills in general\|Skills]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Talent\|Talents]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|Specializations]], or spells.

The character must state that they want to train and must also specify exactly what they will be training. Training can only be done once every 24 hours, with the training session lasting at least 1 story hour and focusing on only one thing (for example, the character will train the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]"). If the character trains multiple things, their training must alternate day by day.

> [!example] 
> - The character is a chef and wants to learn to cook better. This is achieved by training in soup cooking.
> - In the training roll, they roll the Talent “chef” with the skill “working with hands”
> - (meaning it will be 3 + chef + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] )

> [!important] 
> Basic attributes are not rolled during training. Their substitutes are rolled.
> - For [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] it is “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]”, 
> - For [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] it is “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]”, 
> - For [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] it is “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]” 
> - For [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] it is “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intuition\|Intuition]]”.

#### Training Challenge Level

During training, the character rolls the dice against the difficulty level, which is equal to the level of the Skill (Attribute, Talent, Specialization) the character is training.

>[!example]
> * When a character is training “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]” and this skill is at level 0, or -1, -2, in that case, the CL is 0.
> * When a character is training “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]” and this skill is at level 1, in that case, the CL is 1.
> * When a character is training “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]” and this skill is at level 4, in that case, the CL is 4.

The training challenge level can also change based on circumstances. For example, when a character is learning to swim in a river and the river has a strong current, in that case, the challenge level will be higher. If the character finds a good teacher, such as a martial arts master, or has better conditions for training, then the challenge level is lowered. However, the training challenge level must never be negative.

The training challenge level affects the total number of victories (i.e., training points) the character gains from the training roll. This means that the victories from the roll are reduced by the challenge level.

>[!example]
>- The character rolled 6 victories
>- With a CL of 2, they receive 4 training points
>- With a CL of 4, they receive 2 training points

#### Gaining Training Points

From each training roll, the character gains at least 1 training point (never less).

Additional points are awarded for all victories rolled on the dice that have been reduced by the challenge level. These [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|Points of Training]] are recorded next to the respective Attribute, Skill, Talent, or Specialization as a number expressed in thousandths (for example, 2 victories are recorded as 0.002).

Individual points from different training sessions are then added together with the total number of points. For example, if the character gained 0.003, 0.005, 0.001, 0.004 points during various training sessions, they are added together, resulting in 0.013. Additional training points can also be gained through the system of “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|reward points]]”.

- To gain 1 point in an Attribute, 1000 training points are needed.    
- To gain 1 point in a Skill, Talent, or Specialization, 100 training points are needed.

#### Injury During Training

During training, it can happen that the character gets injured. However, this only threatens in case of a complete failure in the dice roll, meaning when no victories are rolled. The maximum level of injury is always 1, never more. It is important that the character MUST NOT train while injured.

#### Joint Training

The rule for joint training can be used when several friendly characters join together to train. In such a case, the friendly characters perform actions against each other as if they were in an active conflict. They can arm-wrestle each other ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]), try to convince each other with good arguments ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]), or play chess against each other ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]]). Characters can also fight each other (so-called sparring), where the result of the combat roll is not an injury but, for example, knocking the opponent down or disarming them. Players must notify the narrator that they are going to train together, and they must also state what they will be training. The narrator must agree with this (or can change something if necessary).

Characters can train all Skills, Talents, combat Talents, and Specializations in joint training. However, only the same ones or those that have the same function. For example, if one character trains the skill “[Raw Strength],” the other character must train either the same skill or something that works the same way as “[Raw Strength]” (such as the spell “strong wind” from a wizard). Joint training is limited to three rounds. Players can continue training for the sake of the story, but victories for skill, talent, or specialization improvement are counted only from the first three rounds.

The number of training points that characters record in their attributes, skills, etc., are summed up and added to both characters at once - they are not divided between the characters. The challenge level of the training is determined according to the character with the lowest level in the given skill (talent, etc.). Characters take at least 1 victory from each round.

#### Items and Training

During training, characters can use appropriate items or spells to help them (e.g., dumbbells for strength training, a golem for archery training). However, their use must be approved by the narrator. Auxiliary items add extra dice to the roll according to their highest attribute (for example, if a golem has 3 health points, it adds 3 dice. If the golem has 3 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and 4 attack, it only adds 4 dice, not 7).

#### Teacher

To increase their points in Attributes, Skills, Talents, or Specializations, characters can choose to train under the guidance of a teacher (or researcher, scientist, scholar, craftsman, or martial arts master, etc.). The teacher increases the total number of victories the character gains from training by multiplying the number of victories achieved by the teacher's level, reduced by the character's level.

> [!example] 
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 3, the character has agility 0. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 3 (because 3 - 0 = 3).
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 5, the character has agility 2. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 3 (because 5 - 2 = 3).
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 3, the character has agility 2. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 1 (because 3 - 2 = 1).

When the teacher's level and the character's level are the same, the character cannot learn from the teacher. When the character's level is negative, the training multiplier is calculated as if the character's level were 0.

> [!example] 
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 3, the character has agility -2. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 3.
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 3, the character has agility -1. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 3.
> * The teacher has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 3, the character has agility 0. In this case, the number of training points is multiplied by 3.

##### Cost of Learning

The cost of learning is determined by the teacher's level, not by the multiplier. The teacher's level is considered an attribute, so for each level of the teacher, 4 wealth points are paid.

A character can also gain new abilities under the guidance of a teacher - that is, they can learn new Talents or Specializations that they did not know before. Newly acquired abilities are recorded in the table with level 0, along with the victories the character received during training from the teacher (e.g., “fire school 0.052”). The character can use these new abilities even at level 0 because they are still learning. However, until they reach level 1, they will lose 2 dice from the roll in situations requiring a special Talent.

> [!Important] 
> Characters cannot be teachers to each other. The teacher must be someone outside the player group (which means they are not a member of the player group).


#### New Talents and Spells

Characters can learn completely new Talents or specializations, but only from external sources. This means they must find a teacher, discover a secret book, or serve a deity that grants them the talent as a reward. Characters cannot teach each other new talents and spells. They can only train those they already have.

### Other points

The narrator may decide to use points other than those used in our RPG system. These "other" points are used in various situations and denote different states. Therefore, each point has its own rules.

#### Points of Offensive

**Pain**

Pain points are used when an attacker causes pain to their victim instead of injury. The attacker can exchange 1 level of victory for 1 pain point (which the victim receives). When the victim accumulates 10 pain points, they can no longer fight and fall out of the battle because the pain becomes unbearable, and the character faints. The victim can use 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] to "cleanse" themselves of 3 pain points.

**Stress**

Pain does not have to be physical. Therefore, the narrator may decide to use Stress points, which are added when the attacker attacks their victim using [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] skills or when they use the victim's phobia against them. When the victim accumulates 10 Stress points, they can no longer fight and fall out of the battle because the stress becomes unbearable, and the character faints. The victim can use 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] to "cleanse" themselves of 3 stress points.

**Heat (element)**

If the narrator uses elements in their story, they can add Heat points (or Cold points, etc.) to a character. These points are added when the attacker uses a weapon with an element (e.g., fire) against their victim. When the victim accumulates 10 element points, they can no longer fight and fall out of the battle because the effect of the element becomes unbearable, and the character faints. The victim can use 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] to "cleanse" themselves of 3 element points.

#### Points of Defense

**Advantage**

Advantage points are accumulated when the attacker does not use their victory levels during their winning turn and simply stores them. These points can be used later if the attack roll fails or if the attacker wants to completely crush their enemy. The narrator has complete freedom in determining how many advantage points a player can store and for how many rounds.

In terms of the story, the successful attacker dodges the attack during the winning turn. The more they dodge, the dizzier the victim becomes. The attacker later uses this for a devastating blow.

#### Magical Essences

Some spells may require an essence or energy for their activation. For example, ice spells may require an ice essence, while fire spells require a fire essence. The narrator can decide whether the essence is necessary for casting the spell or if it just enhances the spell. Each essence is consumed after use.

#### Points in Story

**Water, Food, Sleep, etc.**

The narrator may decide to track how often characters eat, drink, and sleep in their story. Characters may be assigned 5 points for food (or also for water and rest). These points will be spent based on the number of hours that pass, or the narrator can use them to limit time (for example, a character can roll the dice only 5 times in 1 day because they have 5 rest points. Once the character uses their 5 points/rolls, it becomes night, and the character must sleep).

These points can also be used in a post-apocalyptic survival game. When these points run out, speed points are used, and then [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] (for example, a character has 10 food points. When they drop to 0, the character dies. To earn food points (if they don't have food with them), they must spend 1 speed point to "earn" 2 food points. 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|health point]] "earns" 4 food points (or fills all speed points – depending on the narrator's preference). Food points can be spent based on time, with 1 food point consumed every 2 hours, or they can be spent day by day).

Of course, this all depends on the narrator and their game. The food system in a zombie apocalypse will function differently than in a fantasy setting.
