### Dice in general

When a player decides they want to do something in the story, they must determine whether they will succeed or not. This is done using six-sided dice (D6). The player rolls them, and based on the result, the narrator decides success or failure of the intended action.

- If a **1, 2, or 3** appears on the die, it is a failure for that roll.    
- If a **4, 5, or 6** appears on the die, it is a success for that roll.

Failed rolls are ignored. Only the rolls with successes are counted, and each success is counted as one piece. The number on the die is ignored—4, 5, or 6 is the same success. To surpass the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]], the player must roll enough successes—more or equal to the challenge level.

> [!example]
> 
> - A character wants to climb over a fence secretly so that no one notices.
> - The narrator assigns a challenge level of 3 because it's harder than a normal fence climb.
> 
> - The character rolls dice and needs to roll 3 successes.
> -  If they roll 3 successes, they climb over the fence.
> - If they roll 2, 1, or 0 successes, they won't climb over the fence, or they fall from it, or knock something off the fence, making noise and alerting all the guards nearby.

The number of dice a character can roll is determined by their attribute and skill points. For each point in an attribute or skill, the character gets one extra die. For each minus in an attribute or skill, the character loses one die.

#### How Many Dice Can I Use for a Roll?

1. Each character or enemy gets 3 dice for each roll.
2. Additional dice are given for each point invested in the used skill (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] +1).
3. Additional dice are given for each point in the main [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]] that enhances used skill (e.g., for the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], it's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]).
4. Additional dice are given for each point invested in a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] that can be used to solve the problem. If the character doesn't have the talent but the situation requires it, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].
5. Additional dice are given for items the character has (e.g., glasses +1).
6. Additional dice are given for circumstances (e.g., it's foggy).

> [!example]
> * A character wants to open a chest without a key – using lockpicking.
> * The character has: 2 points in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]" and 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] is a supplementary attribute for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]).
> * The character gets 3 dice as a base + 2 dice from the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]" + 1 die from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].
> * The character can use 6 dice for their roll.

> [!example]
> * A character wants to convince a merchant that the samurai sword he wants to sell is much rarer than it actually is.
> * The character has: +3 in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]", +2 in the samurai [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] (because he is selling a samurai sword), and 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] is a supplementary attribute for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]).
> * The character gets 3 dice as a base + 3 dice from the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]" + 2 dice from the samurai [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] + 1 die from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]].
> * The character can use 9 dice for their roll.

Each character gets at least 1 die for their roll, even if they have a lot of minuses (e.g., from injury or circumstances).

### Advantage and Disadvantage

#### Advantage

When the narrator decides that fate favors the character, or the character has a favorable position, or the character decides to use 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]. In this case, the win threshold shifts in favor of the character. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1 or 2**, it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of Advantage)    
- If the die rolls a **3, 4, 5, or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of Advantage)

#### Great Advantage

It works the same way as advantage. It is used when one character in a fight has equipment like from the Middle Ages and the other has equipment from the distant future, or when the character decides to use 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]. In this case, the win threshold shifts in favor of the character. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1**, it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of great Advantage)    
- If the die rolls a **2, 3, 4, 5, or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of great Advantage)

#### Disadvantage

When the narrator decides that fate is not in the character's favor, or the character has an unfavorable position. Or when the character lacks a talent and the situation requires that talent. Or when the character lacks specialization (or talent) for a weapon and the weapon requires specialization. Or when the character decides to restore 1 used [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. In this case, the win threshold may shift against the player. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1, 2, 3, or 4,** it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of Disadvantage)  
- If the die rolls a **5 or 6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of Disadvantage)

#### Great Disadvantage

It works the same way as disadvantage. It is used when a character lacks talent or specialization for magic and intends to use magic. Or when a character lacks a talent required for the situation, and the solution to the situation is very complex even for someone with education. Or when a character lacks specialization (or talent) for a weapon, and the weapon requires specialization, especially if it is a very complex weapon. Or when the character decides to restore 2 used [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. In this case, the win threshold may shift against the player. This means that:

- If the die rolls a **1, 2, 3, 4, or 5,** it will be a loss for that die (under the influence of great Disadvantage)    
- If the die rolls a **6,** it will be a win for that die (under the influence of great Disadvantage)

### Success and Failure

When a character rolls dice, all successes on their dice are counted. Then they are compared to the challenge level and evaluated. After rolling dice, the following cases may occur :

#### Complete Success

The character surpasses the challenge level and only successes appear on all their dice. For example, if the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] is 3 and the character rolled 6 successes out of 6 dice, it means the character will successfully accomplish the task exactly as they intended, and they may also receive a bonus from the narrator.

> [!example]
> - A character opens a chest without a key - they find rare metals or something important that makes the game easier for them.
> - A character doesn't open the chest without a key because they suddenly discover there's a bomb inside. The chest can be safely defused to prevent it from exploding somewhere. For example, it can blow up a wall or a door.

In case of full success, the narrator may decide to reduce the character's challenge level in the next roll, or give them an automatic success in the next roll.

- List of Complete Success (levels)
- 1 / 1 = no bonus    
- 2 / 2 = no bonus    
- 3 / 3 = -1 challenge level or +1 success    
- 4 / 4 = -1 challenge level or +1 success    
- 5 / 5 = -2 challenge level or +2 successes    
- 6 / 6 = -3 challenge level or +3 successes    
- 7 / 7 = -4 challenge level or +4 successes    
- 8 / 8 = -5 challenge level or +5 successes    
- more than 8 = -6 challenge level or +6 successes

#### Success

The character surpasses the challenge level. For example, if the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] is 3 and the character rolled 3 successes or more, then the character will successfully accomplish the task exactly as they intended. Or it might happen slightly differently, depending on the narrator. But it's always a success.

> [!example]
> - A character opens a chest without a key - they find gold or something important.
>  - A character doesn't open the chest without a key because they suddenly discover there's a bomb inside.

Alternatively, the character's challenge level for the next roll can be reduced by 1 upon success.

#### Story Failure

The character does not surpass the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]]. For example, if the challenge level is 3 and the character rolled 2 successes or less, then the character will not accomplish the task they wanted to do because they failed in their action. The character made a mistake, or something went wrong. The narrator will say exactly how the character failed and what happened.

> [!example]
> - The character opens the chest despite missing the challenge level, but the chest is empty.
> - Or they couldn't open the chest.
> - Or there was a bomb in the chest that exploded.

The level of story failure depends on how much the character missed the challenge level. The fewer successes the character has, the worse the outcome.

>[!example]
>The character tries to climb a wall at night, especially secretly so that no one sees them. The challenge level is 4.
>- 4 successes = Success, the character managed to climb the wall.
>- 3 successes = The character climbs up the wall, jumps through a window, and there is a guard.
>- 2 successes = The character slips, breaks a part of the wall, and it falls down. It can injure another character, or the stone can fall on the guards and they notice the character.
>- 1 success = The character falls from the wall. They must roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|dice]] to see if they can hold on or survive the fall.

#### Complete Failure

The character not only fails to surpass the challenge level, but also rolls no successes at all—only failures. In this case, not only does the character fail to accomplish the task they wanted to do, but something much worse happens.

> [!example]
> - The character opens the chest and a monster appears that they must defeat.
> - Or they make a noise and guards come
> - Or the bomb in the chest explodes and the floor collapses under the character.
> - The character falls from the wall and breaks their leg. Their fall and cry are heard by all the guards nearby.

In case of complete failure, the narrator may decide to increase the character's challenge level in the next roll, or the character automatically loses dice in the next roll.

- List of Complete Failure (levels)
- 1 / 1 = nothing    
- 2 / 2 = nothing    
- 3 / 3 = +1 challenge level or -1 die    
- 4 / 4 = +1 challenge level or -1 die    
- 5 / 5 = +2 challenge level or -2 dice    
- 6 / 6 = +3 challenge level or -3 dice    
- 7 / 7 = +4 challenge level or -4 dice    
- 8 / 8 = +5 challenge level or -5 dice    
- more than 8 = +6 challenge level or -6 dice

#### The Narrator Always Decides

What happens in case of success or failure is always decided by the narrator, who adjusts the story accordingly. A success doesn't always have to be a pure success (or gain), but it can also be opening a door behind which another path for the character might be waiting. Similarly, failure doesn't always have to be a "failure" (or loss), but it can be a new obstacle that leads the characters to the same goal, but through a different path than they intended. Everything depends solely on the story and the narrator.

#### Transfer of Successes

When characters perform the same action and one character fails their dice roll—meaning they don't surpass the challenge level while others do—those characters who surpassed the challenge level can help the one who didn't. They do this by transferring their successes. The number of successes that successful characters can transfer depends on the challenge level. They can only transfer successes that exceed the challenge level.

> [!example]
> A very dangerous enemy appears and the characters need to hide in a haystack.
> The characters roll their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|stealth]] skill against a challenge level of 3.
> 
> 1 character rolls 4 successes (surpassed [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] and could transfer 1 success)
> 2 character rolls 3 successes (surpassed [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] but can't transfer any success)
> 3 character rolls 2 successes (didn't surpass the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]], needs 1 success)
> 
> Character 1 helps Character 3 by transferring one of its successes. All characters successfully hide, even at the last moment.

Transferring successes can happen in all actions that characters perform together and simultaneously. Except in the case of attacking an enemy, which is considered fighting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances#Boj s viacerými nepriateľmi\|multiple enemies]].

### Skill check - dice roll

Skill check is rolled when something prevents a character from performing an action.

   >[!example]
  >- A character is in deep water and wants to attack someone.
  >- The water impedes their movement, so the character must roll a control check for the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]].

When a character is in difficult circumstances that hinder their activity, the narrator determines which skill (and with which talent) will be rolled for the control check. The narrator also sets the Challenge Level ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]]), which depends on the difficulty of the situation. For example, deep water might have a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] of 3, while deep water with a strong current might have a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] of 5.

If the character succeeds in the control check, they can perform (and roll) their intended action exactly as they want. The character can get into the next roll as many successes as they exceeded the challenge level. These successes reserve dice for the next roll (see note below).

If the character does not meet the challenge level, they cannot perform the intended action at all, or they lose as many dice in the next roll as they were short of the challenge level.

> [!info] In the game, it will look like this:
> - A character is in deep water and wants to attack someone.
> - The narrator says that the character must roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] against a challenge level of 3.
> <br>
> - The character rolls, for example, 4 successes.
> - This means they can attack the enemy (i.e., roll directly for the combat roll).
> - At the same time, 1 success from their combat roll is reserved for them.
> - This means that if they have, for example, 6 dice in the combat roll, 1 die is automatically converted into a success.
> - And therefore, they will roll with only 5 dice.


</div></div>


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/02-dice/rpg-quick-check/#quick-check-dice-roll" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



### Quick check - dice roll

In the story, there might be situations where a character needs to quickly react to a danger that could cause injury or death. In these situations, the narrator will tell, which skill the character must roll. For every point the character misses the challenge level, they lose that many [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]. After successful Quick Check, the character does not receive any success or dice for the next roll.

> [!example]
>- The character is falling from a great height.
>- The narrator says they must roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]" against a CL of 4.
>- Let's say the character rolls with 6 dice and gets 3 success.
>- They missed the CL by 1, so they take 1 injury (i.e., -1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]).

>[!example]
> - The character is driving and another car is rushing towards them
> - The narrator says they must roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]]" to avoid the car.
> - The CL is 4, and the character rolls with 7 dice, getting 5 success.
> -The character successfully meets the CL and takes no injury.

#### Quick skill check and Luck roll

If the narrator doesn't know what difficulty to assign to a quick action, they can roll for luck, with the following results:

1. Great misfortune = CL 6 or CL 3 + the CL the narrator wanted
2. Major misfortune = CL 5 or CL 2 + the CL the narrator wanted
3. Minor misfortune = CL 4 or CL 1 + the CL the narrator wanted
4. Minor fortune = CL 3 or CL 1 - the CL the narrator wanted
5. Major fortune = CL 2 or CL 2 - the CL the narrator wanted
6. Great fortune = CL 1 or CL 3 - the CL the narrator wanted

### Quick Reaction - Dice roll

In the story, there may be a situation where a character wants to act immediately, but cannot because they are doing something else, carrying a heavy backpack, and the situation has "escalated quickly".

If the character wants to react immediately - they must roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]" against the challenge level determined by the narrator. If they pass the challenge level, they can react immediately and continue with another skill or roll. (For example, if they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] and pass the challenge level, they can immediately roll a combat roll.)

If the character does not pass the challenge level, they must wait an extra round (or however many rounds they missed the challenge level by).

The character does not receive any success or dice for the next roll in a quick reaction roll.

### Assistance – dice roll

Assistance is a special dice roll where multiple characters join together to help each other. One character can help another, for example, with fixing a car, or they go together to break down doors and so on.

Assistance works the same way as the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Success and Failure#Transfer of Successes\|Transfer of Successes]]. So characters roll the same dice with the same skills against the same challenge level. When characters surpass the challenge level, they transfer their successes (those above the level) to the character they are assisting. This also means that if the helping characters fail the roll, nothing is transferred (and nothing is reduced). Similarly, nothing is transferred when the helping characters reach the challenge level. They must exceed it.

> [!example]
> * Character 1 wants to break down a door. 
> * Character 2 decides to help them.
>  <br>
> * Character 1 will roll, for example, with 5 dice against a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|challenge level]] of 3
> * Helping Character can roll with 6 dice against [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] 3
> <br>
> * Character 1 rolls, for example, 2 successes
> * Helping Character rolls, for example, 4 successes. They can transfer 1 success ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/CL\|CL]] 3 - 4 successes)
> <br>
> * 1 success is transferred to Character 1, allowing them to surpass the challenge level. And the characters break down the door together.

The character (who wants to help) must ask the narrator if they can help the other character. When the narrator agrees, the "helper" will roll dice with the same skill as the character. They can also use a talent if it applies to the problem (for example, the pyrotechnics [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] to defuse a bomb). The base challenge level for assistance is the same as the challenge level of the activity being assisted. When a character assists an activity that requires a talent and the assisting character does not have that [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]], they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

Multiple characters can help one character. However, if it's a roll where characters can get hurt and the characters fail, all characters (including those who helped) will receive the same damage as the character being helped, though the damage is reduced by armor for each character separately.

Assistance cannot be used on an assistance roll that is meant to assist something. It can only be used once and on the final roll. If a character is performing something difficult or time-consuming, they cannot participate in assistance. Other characters must wait until it is completed.

### Self-assistance

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] cannot be used to assist another character; that's what [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Assistance\|Assistance]] is for. The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] roll  is used when the character wants to help themselves, or during [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Quick check\|quick skill check]], or as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Quick Reaction\|Quick Reaction]], or during combat when the character wants to use a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]] or an item.

The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]] roll is made just like any other regular roll, but against the challenge level set by the narrator. The minimum level, however, is 3. The number of successes achieved in the self-assistance roll are reduced by the challenge level and then transferred as wins to the next roll (they are helping). It can happen that the number of wins from the self-assistance roll is lower than the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|Challenge Level]] - in such a case, the wins are subtracted from the next roll.

### Chase - dice roll

Chase is rolled when one character tries to escape from another character, or when a character tries to escape from some threat. The narrator determines the moment from which the characters start chasing each other, as well as the distance from which the chase starts (chase may not start from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/0 - BOOK and RPG CH/RPG - CH 01 C - Dice roll#Chasing and Distances\|medium distance]]). The characters then roll dice against each other, meaning one rolls dice and successes are noted. Then the other rolls dice and successes are noted. And the difference between characters is evaluated.

If the "attacker" (the one chasing) has more successes, the distance between them decreases. If the attacker wins when they are close to their victim, the attacker catches the victim. If the attacker is closer, they can use their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]] or luck to stop the victim. They can push their victim against a wall, or even if they are on a horse, they can injure the horse to make the victim fall. When the attacker catches the victim, the attacker gets one advantage - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances#Výhodnejšie postavenie\|better position]].

When the victim wins more often, they distance themselves from the attacker, and if the victim is sufficiently far away, they escape from the attacker.

#### Chase and Distance

* **Close**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, they catch the victim.
        * A combat roll is then made additionally, with the attacker gaining an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances#Advantageous position\|advantage]] to their roll.
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, the distance between them increases to "medium."
* **Medium Distance**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, the distance decreases to "close."
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, the distance increases to "greater."
* **Greater Distance**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, the distance between them decreases to "medium."
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, the distance between them changes to "great distance."
* **Greatest Distance**
    * When the **attacker** wins the dice roll, the distance decreases to "greater."
    * When the **victim** wins the dice roll, they escape from the attacker and the chase ends.

> [!note]
> There is a difference between perceiving closeness and distance – whether the character is in a car, a spaceship, or running on foot or on a horse. The distance is determined by the narrator.

#### How to Roll for Chase?

When a character is running - they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] skill. If a significant obstacle (such as a car) appears, it is necessary to make a skill check, for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], or any other appropriate skill before the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] roll. When a character is riding a horse or driving a car - they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]]. If an obstacle appears, it is necessary to make a check, for example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], before driving, so the character notices the obstacle and can react better to it.

### Luck dice roll

Luck changes the current situation either for the better or for the worse. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|Luck roll]] refers to what is happening around the character at that moment. Therefore, it can only affect the "now," at the place where the character is standing, or for approximately one hour. A luck roll made by a character in the middle of the game cannot change the end of the game, nor can its result appear six months later.

A luck roll is used when:

1. The character wants to determine if they will have luck in finding something (They need gasoline - they go to an abandoned gas station and roll for luck to see if there is any).
2. The character wants to determine if the change that just occurred will worsen or improve their situation (It starts raining - will it be a heavy rain or just a drizzle? Will it be thick rain that reduces visibility for the enemy or the character?).
3. Something happens and the character needs to react quickly (This determines the challenge level for solving the problem, for example, how many rounds they have to disarm a bomb).
4. The character finds a shop. Whether it will have everything they need and at what price (for example, the shop could be very expensive or it might not have what they are looking for).
5. The character is under attack - the dice determine the enemy's strength (for example, whether the enemy will have strong weapon and armor).
6. The narrator wants to change the story (The characters will travel to another city for a week. The narrator rolls the dice - if it results in luck - the characters find a treasure map, if it results in misfortune - the characters are attacked by bandits).

If the narrator wants, they can use the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter\|random encounter]] table to spice up the game, they don't have to rely solely on the luck rule.

#### Result of the Luck Roll and What It Means

Luck is rolled with a standard 6-sided die. In this case, it is as follows:

1. Great misfortune
2. Major misfortune
3. Minor misfortune
4. Minor fortune
5. Major fortune
6. Great fortune

##### 1. Great Misfortune

The greatest misfortune possible. It's as if all of Murphy's laws combined to cause harm.

 > [!example]
 > The character is going through a tunnel. They come across a secret door they want to open. They roll for luck to see what awaits them. They roll a 1. Behind the door is a secret enemy base and fully armed. By opening the door, character just triggered the alarm.

    - Or the character finds the item, but using it increases the challenge level by 2 in every dice roll.        
    - Or the character finds the item, but in order to use it, they must solve a problem with a challenge level of 3.        
- Challenge Level    
    - The challenge level is 6, or CL +3.        
- Possibilities    
    - Among all the possibilities the narrator considers, this is the worst one. Much worse than intended.

- Disasters    
    - A large-scale disaster occurs near the character. It could be a few meters from where they stand or close family (e.g., spouse).        
- Services

- Spell Failure    
    - Wizard is damaged by 3 HP, or : cannot cast spells for 3 days, major enemy enhancement, destruction of a magical item, room destruction.

    - The complete opposite of the potion's intended effect happens, and of course to the character's detriment.

##### 2. Major Misfortune

What wasn't supposed to go wrong, went wrong, or a coincidence worsened the current situation by about 100%.

> [!example]
> The character is going through a tunnel. They come across a secret door they want to open. They roll for luck to see what awaits them. They roll a 2.
