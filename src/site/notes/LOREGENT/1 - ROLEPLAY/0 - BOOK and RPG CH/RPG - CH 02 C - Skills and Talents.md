### Skills in general

A skill is an activity a character performs in a story when they encounter an obstacle (e.g., locked door), a problem occurs (e.g., broken car), or when the character wants to achieve something (e.g., encrypt a message).

#### Skills and Points

Unless otherwise specified, each character has **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/15 points\|15 points]]** available to invest in any skill (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]]).

The maximum number of points a player can invest in each skill is limited by the narrator. Unless otherwise stated, a player can invest a maximum of 6 points in each skill.

However, a player can also take on negatives. Points can be subtracted from each skill up to a value of minus 2. That is the maximum (or minimum, rather). A skill cannot be minus 3, and certainly not minus 4.

#### Skills and Dice Rolls

The number of dice a character can use in a roll is calculated as follows:

- 3 dice as a base
- plus/minus dice for each point in the given Skill    
- plus/minus dice for each point in the Attribute that is key to the given skill    
- plus/minus dice for circumstances that may occur in the story (e.g., slippery stairs)

Only one skill can be used for each problem. However, sometimes in a story, a problem can be solved with multiple skills. In such cases, the player must choose one skill, or can choose two, but one of the two chosen skills must be rolled as a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

#### Skills and Number of Dice

For every point invested in a skill (talent or specialization), the character gets an extra die when rolling that skill.

>[!example]
 >- The character has 1 point in the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]".
 >- When they roll the skill "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]", they get +1 extra die.
 >- If they had 4 points in the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], they would get +4 extra dice.

A skill can be used even if the character has no points assigned to it. In that case, the player gets 3 base dice for every roll, plus any additional dice for the primary attribute of the skill. If the character has a minus in the skill (or its primary attribute), they lose dice.

> [!example] 
> The character wants to find a potion bottle in a closet. For searching, the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill is used. (In this example, the character has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 0)
> 
> * If they have 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill, they will roll 3 dice.
> * If they have 2 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill, they will roll 5 dice.
> * If they have -1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill, they will roll 2 dice.

> [!example]  
> The primary attribute increases the number of dice in the roll. For the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill, the primary attribute is [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].
>  
> - If the character has 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 3 dice.
> - If the character has 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and 1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 4 dice.
> - If the character has 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and -1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 2 dice.

> [!example]
> - If the character has 2 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and 2 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 7 dice.
> - If the character has -1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and 1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 3 dice
> - If the character has 4 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and -1 point in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 6 dice.
> - If the character has 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] skill and 0 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] attribute, they will roll 3 dice.

#### Skills and Talent

Learn more about this topic in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]]. Here’s a brief overview.

Talent is a character’s natural ability for an activity (e.g., painting pictures), or it’s a profession or hobby. In our RPG system, it’s a supplement to skill. This means that when a character rolls dice for a skill, they can add points from their talent to that skill. This applies when the talent is needed to solve the problem (e.g., a doctor for treating deep wounds, or a mechanic for fixing an engine).

Talent is used only for solving problems or for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice rolls. Talent is not used in combat.

#### Skills and Specialization

Learn more about this topic in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|Specialization]]. Here’s a brief overview.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] is almost the same thing as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]]. However, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] differs from talent in that it’s used only in combat when the character wants to perform a particular [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]].

Their main attribute is Strength – [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]. The number of dice that a character or narrator can roll is calculated as 3 dice + skill + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]].

The list below details each skill and its appropriate use. The names and uses of each skill can be adjusted by the narrator to fit their world and story.

>[!note]
>Each skill also has a so-called verb list. This is a list of all the actions the skill can perform. If something is missing, you can add it.

#### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]]

It is used to control endurance when running, speed of running, and control of jumping, such as how high or far the character can jump. It is also used to control running or walking when the character runs (or walks) through difficult terrain (e.g., deep snow). [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] is the main skill used during [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Chase\|chases]]!

If a character wants to walk, run, or jump over difficult terrain that requires some training and the character lacks training, they roll at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. For example, when they want to walk through deep snow like in Antarctica, or through a desert, or if they have magnetic boots and are walking in zero gravity.

##### All Verbs

#### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]]

It is used to control endurance or the ability to move in unusual environments. Mobility mainly involves swimming in water, climbing rocks, rope climbing, or climbing over a fence. It also includes flying in zero gravity or in the air (like Ironman). In simple terms, it’s movement involving the whole body, not just the legs.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] also includes normal movement in relatively normal conditions. If the conditions are not normal, this skill requires a talent. Otherwise, the character rolls at a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. (For example, swimming in a pool is different than swimming in the open sea).

##### All Verbs

Movement: 
Climbing, Rock climbing, Climbing, Climbing a rope or tree, Swimming

Change in height: 
Jumping, Flying, Flying in the air, Flying in zero-gravity space

##### Talent Combinations

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] focuses on the body's defense against attacks – whether physical, chemical, bacterial, etc. If the character has a status (e.g., poison), the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]] skill is used to mitigate the effect of the poison. The amount by which the character falls short of the challenge level reduces [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]], gives fewer dice for the next roll, or worsens their overall situation (e.g., unable to walk). If the character surpasses the challenge level, they mitigate the status effect (poison). The more successes they roll, the more they reduce the effect duration (e.g., poison affects for 4 rounds instead of 8). This is just an example; the narrator can adjust it.

##### All Verbs

Resistance to injury: 
Resistance, Deflection, Stopping, Defense, Protection

Resistance to external influences: 
Reach somewhere, Hold on, Keep, Wait, Continue, Not finish, Manage, Stand up

Resistance to poisons:

Of course, this applies if the task is simple, common, or something that a regular "technically skilled" person in that world could do. For more complex tasks (like hacking a PC, replacing car electronics, building a washing machine), this skill must be combined with a talent. Otherwise, the character rolls with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

##### All Verbs

Machine or mechanism: 
Build, Create, Repair, Improve, Enlarge, Reduce, Open, Close, Weaken, Break, Explode, Worsen, Replace components

Operating a machine: 
Set up, Program, Use software

Other: 
Build a watch, Repair a computer, Create spreadsheets on a computer (or edit videos), Repair a car, Hack into another computer network (by overcoming protection)

##### Construction or Repair:

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] are used when dealing with a machine. If a character wants to build, improve, repair, program, or operate a machine, they roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]. If they want to create an item using a machine, they also roll [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]].

For example, if a blacksmith wants to make a sword using a machine, like a computer-controlled lathe or something similarly complex, they roll "Technical skills." If they use their hands to make the sword, they roll "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]" (though in this case, "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]" could also apply).

##### Combinations with Talents

> [!example]
> * Hacker - Uses a computer to obtain secret (locked) information or to disable a device connected to the internet.
> * Archemist - Uses electrophoresis to extract magical essence from a plant.
> * Blacksmith - Programs a machine to make a sword or armor.
> * Auto Mechanic - Replacing car electronics, repairing the engine, programming fuel injection.

#### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] focuses on everyday life skills and overall survival. This includes preparing food (e.g., if a character wants to bake a cake), repairing clothes (e.g., if a character wants to sew a shirt), and treating injuries or providing overall medical care.

For more complex tasks or those requiring formal education, this skill must be combined with a talent. Otherwise, the character rolls with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

##### All Verbs

Survival: 
Healing wounds, Treating illnesses, Providing first aid, Starting a fire, Setting up a tent, Using common survival skills in the wild

Domestic skills: 
Cooking, Baking, Sewing, Cleaning, Ironing

Crafting: 
Drawing, Painting, Sculpting, Assembling furniture, Gluing

##### Healing, Crafting, Repairing, Survival:

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] is used for treating simple wounds (for deeper wounds, a character needs a talent).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] is used for cooking, baking, sewing, and other household chores. Therefore, it can also be used for creating items that require only knowledge and skilled hands but not complex machines. For example, brewing potions, embroidering magical runes into fabric, creating a statue (which a wizard might later bring to life), stringing beads (making a magical necklace), and so on.

##### Crafting or Repairing:

What if a blacksmith wants to forge a sword? If it's a regular blacksmith making a regular sword, they can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] If the blacksmith uses machines (like a computer-controlled lathe or something similarly complex), they use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]], because it's the machine (and not the blacksmith) making the sword.

##### Combinations with Talents

> [!example]
> * Cook - Prepares a complex dish.
> * Painter - Paints a complex picture.
> * Herbalist - for brewing potions, grinding herbs, drying, or other preparations (these preparations are similar to those in a regular kitchen).
> * Doctor - Cleans and stitches deep wounds. They know how to do it because they learned it.

### What about other skills?

#### Swimming, Flying, Low Gravity, etc.

To control body movement in unusual materials or situations that hinder or restrict motion, special dice rolls are made. To be precise [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] (e.g., astronaut talent + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] = when floating around a space station in zero gravity).

These special movement rolls determine, whether the character drowns, falls from the sky, collides with something (in a zero-gravity environment), or executes a particular [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]] (in the unusual material) as desired. The [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] skill overall is also used for climbing cliffs, ropes, or fences, and similar activities.

It must be specified for which material the talent can be used, as some materials are similar to each other. If rolling for a different material than what the character is specified for, the dice roll is made with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

> [!note] Categories of Material
>* Liquids (e.g., water = zero-gravity space) 
>* Empty spaces or gases (e.g., air = zero gravity = flying)
>* Granular (e.g., quicksand = snow = beans) and their storm variants (e.g., snowstorm)
>* Muddy (e.g., jelly = swamp)
>* Vertical ( napríklad skaly = tyče = laná )

#### Pilot and Ride

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] is a talent that brings the knowledge of controlling a self-moving vehicle. It is used for its control, piloting, and steering. A character with this talent can adjust their course to avoid obstacles, adjust their speed to reach the goal as soon as possible, or adjust their angle for better shooting from the vehicle.

The talent for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] is rolled in combination with the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]. Other skills can be rolled as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Skill check\|skill check]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]]. For example, the skill check [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] is rolled when a complex vehicle needs to be started, or when something breaks down in the vehicle. The skill check [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] is rolled during driving. As a check to see if the character notices an obstacle.

When a player allocates points to the talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]], they must choose which type of vehicle the talent applies to. Some vehicles are similar, so points allocated for one vehicle can also apply to another. If a player uses the talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] with a different self-moving vehicle than what the character has designated, the dice from the talent are not counted in the roll. However, the character does not roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

> [!example]  Categories of vehicles (examples)
> * Boards (e.g., skateboard = surfboard = hoverboard )
> 	* in this case it is Talent + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]
>* Personal cars (include all common personal cars)
>* Special personal cars (e.g., sports types like Ferrari, Lamborghini)
>* Vans (e.g., large and long vehicles like buses or trucks)
>* Personal airplanes (include all common planes for one or two persons)
>* Helicopters, Personal spaceships, Military spaceships, Fighters, Fighter-type spaceships, etc.

The Talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (and the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]) is used during [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Chase\|chases]] with cars, (etc.)!

> [!example] Examples of use (there can be more)
> * Piloting a spaceship, driving a car, driving a formula, riding a horse, riding a skateboard,
> * How quickly do they reach the finish line?
> * Do they dodge a bullet when an enemy tries to shoot the tires?
> * The dam breaks, and the character jumps onto a floating tree (which at that moment "turns" into a surfboard)

> [!note]
> - When it comes to flying, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|Mobility]] is used when the device (or wings) are part of the character's body and the character uses their body for direct control (e.g., Ironman, angel, or hang glider).
> - In combination with the talent [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/z - ostatné/Pilot and Ride\|Pilot and Ride]] (and the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]), flying is used when the device is not part of the body and the pilot boards the machine (e.g., into a fighter jet, or helicopter).

#### Healing Wounds

The skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]” is used for healing wounds. If they are deep wounds, infected, or otherwise complicated, the character must have a talent designated for healing (for example, doctor, herbalist, etc.).

For “healing the wounds of a mechanical being,” the skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]]” is rolled. The same applies as above - for more complex repairs, the character must have a talent.

#### Navigation

Navigation talent is included in talents such as taxi driver, navigator, sailor, hunter, or city thief. Navigation (or orientation) is rolled as a combination of talent + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]. (for example, taxi driver + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] = when wanting to find a shortcut). This talent works similarly to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]], but is focused on spatial orientation, in the landscape, on the planet, or in space. The character has a kind of compass inside them, which helps them know where to go. They know how to read maps, recognize landmarks, navigate a ship by stars, or track (e.g., when hunting an animal).

Navigation (or orientation) is used to find the shortest path if the character wants to avoid an enemy. It is also used in cases where the character wants to find food (e.g., hunt a deer and knows where the pastures are), or when they want to find a plant for a potion.

#### Survival

Survival is the character's ability to survive in the wilderness. Characters can use it for various tasks, such as finding food and water, building a shelter, or even healing injuries.

When rolling dice, a combination of skill and talent is used. For example, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] with the talent hunter can be used to find a deer, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] with the talent mushroom picker for finding edible mushrooms, or the talent adventurer with the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] skill to build a shelter.

#### Talking to Animals / Animal Control

A character can talk to animals (like other characters) only if they have a special talent (or know some magic).

To control an animal (any animal of a particular kind), the character needs a talent (e.g., dog trainer, police dog handler, cat lover, tiger breeder). When the character needs the animal to do something: Talent + skill from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] is rolled, against the challenge level required to control the animal (CL = animal's level).

This roll is made against challenge level 3. However, this level is influenced by the animal's nature, training, or mood. And of course, whether the character wants to scare the animal away or “convince” it to bring something. The narrator determines the level of the challenge. The following list can also help.

- Domestication    
    - wild animals increase the challenge by 1        
    - domesticated animals decrease the challenge by 1        
- Nature    
    - aggressive animals have increased challenge by 1        
    - friendly animals have decreased challenge by 1        
- Intelligence    
    - animals that are less intelligent have increased challenge by 1        
    - animals that are intelligent have decreased challenge by 1        
- Relationship to Humans    
    - animals that have been hurt by humans have increased challenge by 2        
    - animals that do not know humans have increased challenge by 1        
    - animals that know humans but have no special relationship with them (e.g., farm cows) have no change in challenge level
    - animals with a good relationship reduce the challenge by 1 or 2, depending on their relationship with humans.        
- and so on.

##### SOC Skills with Animals and Helpers

- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intuition\|Intuition]]: For example, when the character wants to find out how the animal is doing mentally, wants to discover what might scare the animal, or wants to know who the leader in the group is.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]: 90% of rolls. The character tells the animal what to do (literally persuading it).    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]: The character wants to deceive the animal, for example, pretending to be dead so the animal doesn’t eat them.    
- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intimidation\|Intimidation]]: For example, scaring the animal away, or if the animal wants to eat something and the character wants to forbid it.

#### Encryption

When one character talks to another and doesn’t want anyone to know what they are talking about, a combination of Talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] skill is used. The same applies to writing. However, if they write a message and use a computer (or other device) to _encrypt_ it, a combination of Talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] skill is used, with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] being used as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|self-assistance roll]].

To _decrypt_ a message, Talent and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Intuition\|Intuition]] (if it is a text that can be normally read) or, for an encrypted file, Talent and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] is used.

#### Throwing Objects

A character wants to throw a stone at an enemy, throw a rope to an ally, or throw a large stone at a group of enemies. They can use these skills:

* When they want to throw something heavy and don’t need to aim precisely = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] is used
* When they want to throw something secretly so that no one notices = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Stealth\|Stealth]] is used
* When they want to deceive someone that they threw something = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] is used
* When they want to throw something precisely = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] is used.

#### Lockpicking

When a character wants to unlock a lock without keys (with a lockpick), they can use the following skills:

* When it’s a common lock and they want to unlock it quickly = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] is used
* When it’s a complex lock with various mechanisms or is being opened with a device = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Technical skills\|Technical skills]] is used
* When they want to break the lock with their hands = [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] is used
* The skill “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]” can also be used to unlock a lock, but it will take twice as long (or the challenge level will be +2)

#### Music and Art

- When playing musical instruments, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] skill is used.
- When painting pictures or creating sculptures, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]] skill is used.
- When singing, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] skill is used.
- When acting, a combination of talent and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]] skill is used.

### Talent

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is a natural aptitude for some activity that a character possesses (e.g., being a skilled painter), or it could be something the character has studied (e.g., electrical engineering), a profession (e.g., cook, programmer, healer), or a hobby (e.g., amateur detective). Talent can also be magic (e.g., school of fire, demon summoner, potion master), a superpower (e.g., spider-man, laser eyes, mega strength), or a type of martial art (e.g., boxer, samurai).

Talent indicates the character's primary occupation, their role in the group, or what they are genuinely good at. In video games, the term talent could be equivalent to a class (e.g., ranger, necromancer), a type (e.g., tank, support), or a designation (e.g., healer).

Each character must have at least one talent and can have a maximum of 6 talents. Unless otherwise specified, each player receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/15 points\|15 points]] during character creation to allocate to any skills, talents, or specializations. For every point invested in a talent, the character gains one extra die when performing an activity that requires that talent (e.g., an auto mechanic talent when repairing an engine).

Unless stated otherwise, a player can invest a maximum of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] in each talent. The number of invested points is assessed similarly to attributes or skills (where 0 means an average person and 3 indicates someone very capable).

> [!example]
>* chef 1 = slightly better chef (+ 1 die)
>* chef 2 = good chef (+ 2 dice)
>* chef 3 = great chef (+ 3 dice)
>* chef 4 = excellent chef (+ 4 dice)
>* and so on

If a character has a negative score in a talent (e.g., cook minus 2), they lose points from their dice roll. However, they can still perform specialized activities and, in most cases, prefer doing those activities (like someone who loves to cook, but the food isn't edible).

> [!example]
>* cook minus 1 = really bad cook ( minus 1 die )
>* cook minus 2 = dangerously incompetent cook ( minus 2 dice )

#### Talent and Skills

Talents work as an enhancement to skills. This means that when a character rolls dice for a skill, they can add points from their talent to that skill. However, this only applies when solving a problem requiring education or specific knowledge.

> [!example]
> - A character digs up a crystal and wants to know if it's a diamond or something else.
> - The narrator tells them to roll the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]].
><br>
> - The character has the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] Geology.
> <br>
> - Therefore, their roll includes: 3 base dice + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Knowledge\|Knowledge]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] + Geology.

When a character needs to do something that requires education or special knowledge, and they don't have this education or knowledge (i.e., talent), they roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the activity is magical, very special, or very difficult (even for someone with an education), they roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|great disadvantage]].

> [!example]
> - A character wants to hack into a government computer network. However, they don't have a talent that can be used for hacking. Therefore, they will roll with great disadvantage.
><br>
> - A player wants to brew a potion. However, their character doesn't have a talent that can be used for potion making. Therefore, they will roll with great disadvantage (since it involves magic).
> <br>
> - A player wants to steal a car. However, their character doesn't know how to drive. Therefore, they will roll with disadvantage.

Each talent must specify when it can be used, in what activities, circumstances, and situations. For example, if a character is a Cook and wants to defuse a bomb, they cannot use the Cook skill. They need a talent for defusing bombs, such as - Bomb Technician.

Additionally, talents cannot be combined. One talent cannot enhance another talent, and two talents cannot enhance a single skill. When a situation in the story arises that would allow the use of two suitable talents - the character must choose one.

However, each use of a talent must be approved by the narrator. The narrator determines whether the combination (talent + skill) can be used. This depends on the specific situation in the game (for example, when the character is looking for medicines, they can use the Doctor talent).

####  Talent and Combat

Talent is used for solving problems, not for combat. Only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] is used in combat. Specialization can be combined with other skills during combat. You can find more details in the chapters "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]]" and "[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|Combat Maneuvers]]."

Regarding talent and combat, if a character has a talent applicable to a specific type of weapon or fighting style, the character rolls a combat roll but does not gain any extra dice from the talent, as only specialization increases the number of dice in a combat roll.

However, if the character does not have an appropriate talent for their weapon (or martial art) and does not have a specialization, their combat roll is made with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. For very complex weapons or under very difficult circumstances, they roll with great disadvantage.

### Specialization

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] is similar to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]]. However, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] is used exclusively for combat.

A character can add a specialization for a specific weapon, a certain martial art, a particular armor, or a specific branch of magic to their character sheet. Each character can have a maximum of 3 specializations.

Unless otherwise specified, each player receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/15 points\|15 points]] during character creation to allocate to any skills, talents, or specializations. Unless stated otherwise, a player can invest a maximum of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]] in each specialization. The number of invested points is assessed similarly to attributes or skills (where 0 means an average person and 3 indicates someone very capable).

If a character wants to assign a specialization for a specific weapon or magic (etc.), they just need to write it down in the list of talents and assign points to it (e.g., medium-sized swords 2).

#### Specialization and Skills

Specialization is used exclusively for combat. It can be combined with skills when the character wants to perform a specific [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|maneuver]] during combat. Specialization cannot be used with skills when solving problems in the story. Only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is used for that.

When a character needs to do something that requires education or special knowledge, and the character does not have this knowledge or education (i.e., specialization), they roll with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

When it is an activity that is very special or very difficult (even for someone with education) and the character does not have this knowledge (i.e., specialization), they roll with [[great disadvantage\|great disadvantage]].

#### Specialization and Weapons

Specialization in weapons increases the number of dice in a combat roll when the character uses that weapon. It also increases the maximum damage that the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapon]] can deal to an enemy.

If the character does not have the appropriate talent for their weapon (or martial art) and does not have the specialization, their combat roll is made with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. For very complex weapons or under very difficult circumstances, they roll with great disadvantage
 
#### Specialization and Armor

Specialization in armor increases the number of armor points when the character is wearing that specific type of armor. For example, with Samurai Armor Specialization 1, the character gains +1 armor point when wearing samurai armor.

However, there is an additional restriction for armor specialization. The character must have their entire body covered by a single type of armor – they cannot wear two or three types of armor. This is because they will not receive any benefits from the specialization

> [!note] 
> If the character, for example, wears samurai gloves and boots, but a different type of helmet, the points invested in the specialization will not count. They will be considered as having no armor specialization. 

Armor specialization must be tied to a profession, type of martial art, or certain magic. The character cannot have a specialization in light armors (i.e., light armors of all kinds) – it must specify the type, for example, light samurai armor.

#### Specialization and Magic

All necessary information can be found in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Basics of Magic\|Magic]].

### Change in Attributes and Skills

#### Point Transfer

Every character develops during the story. Some may become stronger, others may weaken, or they may gain new experiences. This story development is captured in the game through the so-called point transfer. Each character can transfer 1 point from any attribute to any other Attribute. This transfer is allowed only once every two played (story) years. Regarding [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skills]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specializations]], a character can transfer 1 point from any Skill to any other Skill, Talent, or Specialization, only once every 2 weeks.

Points can also be transferred such that an Attribute, Skill, or Talent reaches a value below 0. However, this requires the narrator's consent. (This does not apply to specializations).

> [!example]
> The word “Spell” includes: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|magic]], special aptitude, abilities, superpowers, or sci-fi technologies. We use the word “Spell” or the word “Magic” when we do not want to list all the abilities.

#### Increasing Attribute and Skill Points

A character can temporarily increase their attributes or Skills, for example, with the help of a Spell or by purchasing a better weapon (or tool). Additionally, our RPG system offers the possibility of permanent improvement. A character can permanently increase their Attributes and Skills by receiving 1 point from the narrator (which can be invested in an attribute or skill) directly, or by the character [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Training\|training]].

##### 1 point from the narrator

When characters complete a task given to them by the narrator, they can earn 1 point. The narrator decides whether this point can be added to their Attributes, Skills, Talents, or Specializations. However, it is usually a point for Skills (and so on), as 1 point for Attributes requires much greater effort or a much longer period.

>[!example]
>In the story of The Lord of the Rings, Frodo and Sam reached Mount Doom after a long and arduous journey and destroyed the ring. On their journey, they would receive 2 points in Attributes.

The narrator can decide to give the characters multiple tasks—one main and several side tasks—and upon completion of these tasks, the narrator can also give some additional reward. (More about tasks is in the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Rewards\|Points of Rewards]])
