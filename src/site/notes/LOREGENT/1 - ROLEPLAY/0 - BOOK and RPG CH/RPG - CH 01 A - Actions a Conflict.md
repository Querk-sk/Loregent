### Actions

It is an action that a player must or wants to perform. So, they either decide for themselves, or it arises from a situation created by the narrator in the story. An [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Action\|Action]] is performed against something that cannot react, serves as an obstacle or material (for example, cutting down a tree, building a wall, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Mobility\|swimming]] in water, creating a potion from herbs, learning from a book, and similar activities). Or something that does not want to react (healing wounds, playing a musical instrument, carying someone).

Actions make up the majority of dice rolls (approximately 85%) and are essentially almost every activity one can think of.

A player who wants to perform an action must say what they want to do. Based on that, the challenge level is determined by the narrator, which the player must overcome to succeed. The player must roll the dice for the Skill that logically relates to the action. Based on the result of the roll, the narrator tells the outcome (what happened).

> [!Example] 
> The player wants to swim across a river. The river is calm, and the narrator determines a challenge level of 2 (let's say the character has nothing in their inventory). 
> The player has: 
> - 1 in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 
> - 2 in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]] skill 
> - (+) 3 base dice (which are always given) 
> - = 6 dice

The player rolls the dice and depending on the outcome, it will be seen if they succeeded or not.

> [!Example] 
> The player wants to cook a special dinner for guests. It's something complex and difficult to cook. The narrator sets a challenge level of 4. 
> The player has:
> - 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] (the base for the “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]” skill) 
> - 2 points in the “[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]” skill 
> - 2 points in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] cook 
> - (+) 3 base dice (which are always given) 
> - = (8 dice)

### Conflict

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Conflict\|Conflict]] is sort of a battle. It arises when one character decides to perform an action against another character or against something that can actively react. This could be, for example, a sword fight, arm-wrestling, lying, or sneaking (when a character wants to secretly approach someone). Both characters involved in the conflict must roll the same skill that the conflict concerns.

> [!example]
> The characters are arm-wrestling in the tavern. The skill involved is [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]].
> - Character 1 has 1 in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] and 2 in the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] (6 dice).
> - Character 2 has 0 in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] and 1 in the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] (4 dice).
> - Both characters roll dice.
> - The character who rolls more successes wins the conflict and wins the wrestle competition.

Conflicts are divided into [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/passive conflict\|passive]] based on whether the character involved is aware of the conflict or not.

##### Active Conflict

It is an action against a character who is aware of the conflict. This could be, for example, arm-wrestling, competition, running away, negotiating with a merchant about the price, and so on. When characters roll dice and get the same number of successes, they must roll again.

> [!example]
> The characters are arm-wrestling in the tavern. The skill involved is [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]].
> - Character 1 rolled 3 successes
> - Character 2 rolled 3 successes
> - They roll again until someone wins the roll.

##### Passive Conflict

It is an action against a character who is completely unaware of the conflict. This could be, for example, lying, seducing, persuading, sneaking, and so on. When characters roll dice and get the same number of successes, the passive character (the victim) wins the conflict.

> [!example]
> Lying to a merchant
> - A character wants to deceive the merchant that their item is extremely rare.
> - Character 1 rolls 6 dice. 3 + 1 from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + 2 from the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]]
> - The merchant rolls 6 dice. 3 + 0 from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + 3 from the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]]
> - ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] is used as a defense against the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Deception\|Deception]], but any other skill from [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] can be used)
><br>
> - Character 1 and the merchant roll dice
> - Character 1 rolled 4 successes
> - The merchant rolled 4 successes
> - The merchant wins the conflict.
><br>
> -  The merchant wins because he is just listening.
> - The character is active because they are thinking about how to deceive the merchant and therefore speaking.
> - The character must change the merchant's opinion. The merchant already has his opinion.
