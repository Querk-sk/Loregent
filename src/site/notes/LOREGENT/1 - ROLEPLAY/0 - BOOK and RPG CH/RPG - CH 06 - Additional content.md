### Animal Companions

Animal companions are beings that assist the character. They can be pets, "friends," "servants," or "golems." The character doesn't directly control them but gives commands that the companions can understand in their own way (according to their intelligence). Communication with animal companions often involves commands (e.g., "sit!"), sounds (e.g., whistling), body language (e.g., extending an arm forward), and similar methods.

Examples of animal companions include:

- **Pets**: cats, dogs, guinea pigs, and similar animals.    
- **Farm Animals**: cows, sheep, ducks, and similar animals.    
- **Transport Animals**: horses, camels, llamas, and similar animals.    
- **Guard Animals**: dogs, wolves, falcons, and similar animals.    
- **Constructed Beings**: golems, elementals, small personal robots    
- And other similar beings.

Animal companions play an essential role in assisting characters in various tasks, providing support, and enriching the storytelling experience.

#### Attributes of Animal Companions

Animal companions in our system are considered Unimportant Characters (the difference is that companions can have names).

#### Unimportant Character

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Character\|Unimportant Character]] , [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables character/variables character type/Unimportant Enemy\|Unimportant Enemy]]

What it is = A character stronger than extras. This character doesn’t have a name, just a single title and function.

For example = guards on the castle walls, snow demons, or like the special zombies (Spitter) in Left 4 Dead.

Permissions = One attribute (maximum two) is assigned in which points can be placed (e.g., only [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]). Additionally, a talent or specialization is determined, and the character receives the same number of points in it as in the main [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/attribute\|attribute]]. The number of points a character can get is determined by their level or by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].

b. Attributes = Determined by level. Points can be placed in one or a maximum of two Attributes (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2 or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 1). If an odd number of points, the first attribute gets more points. There can also be characters with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attributes.

b. Skills = The character has one [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] - but no points in skills. The number of points in talent and specialization is determined by level.

b. Damage = The maximum damage per round is determined by the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Luck\|character's level]].


</div></div>


> [!example]
> - Bear: Level 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]: 3, Talent: forest environment 3, Weapon specialization: hand protectors 3 (its claws).
> - Bear wants to knock down a tree in the forest: gets 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] + Talent
> - Bear wants to knock down a fence in the city: gets 3 + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]]

When a companion has to do something (e.g., jump over a fence), it rolls a skill check just like a character. Most dice rolls are the same as for regular characters. The difference is that the number of dice may vary (since companions do not have skill points), and if the companion has a talent for a specific environment (e.g., bear in the forest), it does not get talent dice in other environments. In combat, the companion can use talent or specialization for fighting (the character only gets dice from specialization, not talent).

> [!example]
> - Bear looks for food in the forest: gets 3 + Perception + Talent for forest environment
> - Bear looks for food in the city: gets 3 + Perception (no talent dice, as it's not in the forest).
> - Bear attacks: gets 3 + Attributes (i.e., 3 from STR) + Specialization (3 claws). Maximum damage per round is 3 (since its level is 3).

The animal companion is recorded in the character's inventory, along with all attributes and descriptions. The animal companion does not affect the character's inventory but can be used as a pack animal—considered an external inventory like a treasure chest. The companion's inventory size is determined by its level.

>[!example]
>Bear: level 3 = 3 inventory points. (It's also minus 3 for inventory weight, as the bear has STR 3)

#### Specialization for Controlling Animal Companions

To control an animal companion, a character must have a specialization directly related to that specific companion. This specialization only applies to that particular animal companion and not to another, even if it is the same animal or being.

> [!example]
> A character has a bear named Pooh as their pet. In the character table, they write the specialization "Bear Pooh." This specialization is tied only to "Pooh" and not to another bear.

Specialization is necessary for the character to fully control their companion. Therefore, they must invest points in specialization according to the companion's level.

>[!example]
>- Bear Pooh is level 3. Therefore, the character must have 3 points in their specialization.

When the character has the required number of points to control the companion, they do not need to roll any control checks before the companion's roll—the companion simply rolls their dice.

If the character does not have the required number of points, the companion still rolls their dice, but the number of dice is reduced by the number of points the character lacks in their specialization.

If the character has more points than required, the companion gains extra dice.

> [!example]
>The character wants Bear Pooh to knock down a tree. Bear Pooh is level 3.
>
>If the character has 3 points in their specialization, Bear Pooh rolls the dice (the character does not roll).
>
>If the character has 1 point in their specialization, Bear Pooh rolls the dice (the character does not roll), but loses 2 dice from their roll (because Bear Pooh is level 3 - 1 specialization point = minus 2 dice).
>
>If the character has 4 points in their specialization, Bear Pooh rolls the dice (the character does not roll), but gains 1 extra die (because Bear Pooh is level 3 - 4 specialization points = plus 1 die).

If the companion fails the dice roll, they may misunderstand the command and, for example, attack someone else, knock down the wrong tree, or knock down the tree onto the character.

#### Challenge Level for Controlling an Animal Companion

Each animal companion has its own level (tier) that indicates its strength and abilities. The level of the animal is determined by the following list. (Note: the level of a golem or a being summoned by a spell is determined by the number of successes rolled by the character).

**Size**
- Like a mouse (7 - 12 cm) = level + 0    
- Like a cat (20 cm - 45 cm) = level + 1    
- Like a dog (45 cm - 80 cm) = level + 1    
- Like a lion (100 cm - 200 cm) = level + 2    
- Like a horse (140 cm - 240 cm) = level + 2    
- Like a bear (140 cm - 280 cm) = level + 3    
- Like an elephant (550 cm - 650 cm) = level + 4    
- Larger = level + 5    
- Even larger = level + 6    

**Education**
- Wild = level + 0    
- Domesticated = level + 1    
- Trained = level + 2    
- Professionally trained (e.g., police dog) = level + 3    

**Age**
- Juvenile = level + 0    
- Adult = level + 1    
- Senior = level + 2    

**Magical Properties**
- None = level + 0    
- According to the level of magic

### Monsters from Pocket

Monsters from Pocket are, well, monsters that live in a world created by the narrator. These monsters have a purpose, forming part of the ecosystem and food chain. Besides solving human problems (like on a farm), they also engage in battles, as they possess magical abilities and can cast various spells.

In our RPG system, magical monsters (referred to as monsters) are considered "unimportant characters." Their dice rolls work similarly to other characters, as do their points, but their attributes and skills differ slightly.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/03-character/character-in-general/rpg-groups-of-characters/#unimportant-character" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">

</div></div>


#### Attributes, Level, Evolution

Each monster, like any other character, has basic attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]). These attributes receive points based on the monster's level and evolution. The level indicates how many points the monster can distribute among its attributes (1 point per level). Evolution determines how many attributes the monster can allocate points to.

>[!example]
>
>Monster Level 3, Evolution A: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 3
>Monster Level 5, Evolution B: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 2
>Monster Level 8, Evolution C: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] 2

Each monster (and its evolution) has predetermined attributes to allocate points to. It doesn't have to start with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], it could be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] or another attribute. Monsters can have various attribute combinations, such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]. The narrator determines the monster's attributes when creating them for the game.

Each monster is assigned a primary attribute. This attribute receives the most points, especially when the number of points is odd. The remaining attributes receive points according to their order.

However, the trainer character can ignore this rule. When the monster levels up, they can invest a point in any attribute.

##### Level and Evolution

Each monster in our RPG system has three evolutions representing stages of maturity. The first evolution is a juvenile, the second is akin to an adolescent, and the third is adulthood. Each evolution has a set maximum level. When a monster surpasses this level, it evolves to the next stage.

>[!example]
>* Evolution A: Minimum level 1, maximum 4
>* Evolution B: Minimum level 5, maximum 8
>* Evolution C: Minimum level 9, maximum 99

###### Experience

Monsters gain experience by defeating enemies or through training (see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Training\|chapter on training]], attribute training rule). After accumulating 1000 points, a monster advances by 1 level. Each time a level is gained, the monster receives 1 point to invest in one of its attributes.

For each enemy defeated, a monster earns:

- 10 training points (as a base)    
- Plus points for the difference between the monster's level and its enemy's level:   
- Enemy's level minus monster's level, times 10
- If the difference is negative, then 0

##### Monsters and Attributes

Monsters can utilize all basic attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]). However, the number of attributes into which they can allocate points is determined by their evolution.

- Evolution A - only one attribute    
- Evolution B - only two attributes    
- Evolution C - only three attributes

The narrator decides which attributes the monster can use (when creating monsters for their world). Some monsters may have various combinations of attributes, such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]].

When a monster gains 1 point in an attribute, it gains:

- **One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] adds or subtracts:**    
    - +/- 1 die to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills STR\|strength skills]]        
    - +/- 1 to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Health Points]]

        - Plus 1 point for each point invested in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] attribute.            
    - Health regeneration:        
        - Monsters can [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Liečenie zranenia\|regenerate]] using their spell, recovering full [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] (not fractions).        
        - Trainers can regenerate the monster directly in battle or out of battle using a magical item (the monster will receive full health points).          
        - Monsters can fully heal at a healing center (in a city). The cost for healing 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/HP\|HP]] is 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] from the trainer.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each monster has 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].            
        - Plus 1 for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]].            
    - Usage:

        - These points are used for purchasing spells.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]** (aka Special):    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each monster has 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]].

        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] cannot be increased by attributes, levels, or items.            
    - Usage:        
        - Trainers can place one or more items in the monster's inventory. Items add points to attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]).            
        - The weight of each item is determined by how many points it adds to attributes. An item with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] +1 will weigh 1, and so on.            
        - The inventory can also include items that increase basic attack or armor. Their weight will also be 1 per point.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]**    
    - Number of points:

        - Armor doesn't gain points from level or evolution.            
    - Usage:        
        - Protects health points. Armor points are depleted before health points.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Sacrifice\|Points of Sacrifice]]**:    
    - Monsters can sacrifice [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - Speed points can be exchanged for additional actions in battle but only once per round.        
    - For 1 speed point, they get 1 quick action; for 2 points, they get 1 slow action.        
    - Note: All monster attacks are slow actions, while all trainer actions are quick actions.

##### Monsters, Talent, and Skills

Monsters cannot allocate points to talents, specializations, or skills. They can roll for skills normally, with a roll of 3 + the Attribute of the skill.

#### Types of Monsters

Monsters are categorized by their attack type (melee or ranged), their element (e.g., fire or water), and the animal they resemble (e.g., snake or bear).

The most significant impact on gameplay is the attack type and element, which determine how the monster will attack, what spells it will have, and which element it will be disadvantaged against. The type of monster (e.g., ground or flying) is more important for appearance and story, though some types may have additional attacks (e.g., birds may have aerial attacks).

##### Monsters by Movement Type

Each monster moves in a specific way. This has more of a narrative impact than a combat one.

- Ground Type: Monster moves on the ground    
    - Two Legs: Like a monkey or an animal with four legs that walks on two.        
    - Four Legs: Like a cat or dog, etc.        
    - Crawling/Swimming/Flowing: A monster that resembles a snake, or one that can swim in water but crawls on land, or a liquid or jelly that flows.        
    - Levitating/No Legs/Hopping: A monster that levitates a few centimeters above the ground. It's as if it has legs, but doesn't. It may also move by hopping.        
- Flying Type: Monster flies in the air like a bird, or levitates in the air like a bird.    

If the narrator wants the movement type to affect gameplay, they can decide that ground types get +2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] and flying types get +2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] (regardless of the monster's level or evolution).

##### Monsters by Attack Type

Each monster has its weapons (hands, claws, tail, etc.) with which it attacks. These basic weapons follow the same rules as all weapons in LW RPG. The same applies to their spells.

###### Weapon and Armor Types

In battles with monsters, elements and attack types like "sharp weapons, blunt weapons," etc., determine whether the monster fights with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/advantage\|advantage]] / [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]], and how much damage they take.

###### Weapons and Distance

In battles with monsters, spells and weapons follow the same rules as any other weapons in LW RPG. A slight exception is the rule for the complexity of hitting with a ranged weapon. Monster spells do not have a basic complexity level (e.g., medium firearms have a CL of 2), but each ranged spell uses the complexity table based on distance, target's movement speed, and cover (see table).

###### Distances

In battles with monsters, all distances are used except for “Even further” and “Far away.”

#### Elements

Each monster can have only one element.

Elements affect the monster's appearance (e.g., the monster is burning) and attack (even the basic one). This is important because each monster is sensitive to one element and resistant to another. In this document, we will use elements created within LW RPG; however, the narrator can create their own system. In LW RPG, we use primary elements, expanded elements, composite elements, and pseudo-elements. To make this clear, we have created the following list, where we have selected some elements, categorizing each under the main element, according to which sensitivity is determined.

***Fire**
- Fire    
- Lava    
- Plasma    
- Electricity    
- Hot chocolate    
- Anything with higher temperature or functioning like electricity    

**Water**
- Water    
- Snow    
- Ice    
- Ice cream    
- Jelly candies    
- Mud    
- Plants / fungi    
- All liquids or semi-liquids (milk, blood, wine, porridge, etc.)    

**Earth**
- Earth    
- Rock    
- Metal    
- Beetle (poison, acid)    
- Trash / rot    
- Solid candies (caramel)    
- All minerals and solid things (diamond, gold, etc.)    

**Wind**

###### Relationship Between Elements

In combat, each monster with an element can be either weak or resistant to another element. This weakness or resistance affects the attack outcome.

When a monster attacks an enemy whose element is **weak** against the attacker's element:

- The monster rolls with advantage (i.e., a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 counts as a win for that die).    
- The enemy rolls with disadvantage (i.e., only a roll of 5 or 6 counts as a win for that die).    

When a monster attacks an enemy whose element is **strong** against the attacker's element:

- The monster rolls with disadvantage (i.e., only a roll of 5 or 6 counts as a win for that die).    
- The enemy rolls with advantage (i.e., a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 counts as a win for that die).    

When a monster attacks an enemy whose element is **the same** as the attacker's element, the dice are rolled normally (without advantage or disadvantage).

>* The attacker has the Water element, and the enemy has the Fire element.
>* The attacker rolls with advantage (i.e., a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 counts as a win for that die).
>* The enemy rolls with disadvantage (i.e., only a roll of 5 or 6 counts as a win for that die).

##### Armor Type

Similar to characters, monsters also follow the rule regarding weapon and armor types. Each monster can have only one type of weapon and one type of armor, and these types can be different—they don't have to be the same.

>[!example]
>Floraculla - weapon: fangs = piercing melee weapon, armor = resistant to blunt

Armor effectiveness against damage indicates how well the armor mitigates enemy damage. Armors are categorized by their effectiveness against weapons as follows:

### Armor

Armor is a passive protection that shields a character from damage in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]] or during a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/quick solution to the situation\|quick solution to the situation]]. The number of armor points is determined by the narrator. Unless otherwise specified, every character receives **0 armor points**.

Armor can be increased with items like helmets, gloves, or bulletproof vests. Armor can also be permanently increased by a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk\|natural trait]] the character is born with (e.g., a turtle's shell).

There is no maximum armor level, but it can only be reduced to zero. Armor does not go into negative numbers.

#### How Armor Works

Unless otherwise specified, armor is a passive protection that shields [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] by reducing the damage a character would receive from an attacker.

>[!example]
>- The enemy rolls 6 victories in their combat roll
>- The character rolls 2 victories in their combat roll.
> <br>
>- The character's health points should decrease by 4 points.
>- However, the character has 3 armor points.
>- Therefore, their health points decrease by only 1.

Although armor reduces damage, it does not reduce the victory level. So if a character wins the combat roll but does not cause any injury to the enemy, they can use other options listed in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|chapter on victory levels]].

#### Armor Strength

Each piece of protective gear adds armor points directly. All armor points (even from multiple items) are then totaled together. So if a character is wearing, for example, a helmet +1, body armor +3, and boots +2, their armor score would be 6. Armor is calculated separately only when an enemy or character decides to attack a specific part of the body (e.g., attacking the hands).

The armor level of a given item is not judged by the period or genre in which the story takes place. Whether it's medieval, sci-fi, or magical - an armor level of 1 represents weak or small armor, and a level of 5 represents large or high-quality armor.

1. Weak or small armor    
2. Below-average armor or medium armor    
3. Average armor or standard size    
4. Above-average armor or larger    
5. High-quality armor or largest

#### Armor Specialization

All information on specialization can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization#Specialization and Armor\|relevant chapter]]. But in short: the number of points a character invests in specialization for a certain type of armor (e.g., samurai armor) increases their armor points for that specific armor when equipped.

Armor specialization must be tied to a job, type of martial arts, or specific magic. A character cannot have a general light armor specialization for all kinds of light armor but must specify the type, such as light samurai armor.

#### Types of Armor

However, the rating of armor does not end with a number. Each armor must also have its type specified, which indicates which type of weapon the armor is resistant to and which it is weak against. In our RPG system, we divide armor by resistance (against weapons) into three types:

- **Light Armor**: resistant to one type of weapon. It has a weight of 1, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to multiple skills.    
- **Medium Armor**: resistant to two types of weapons. Its weight is 2, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it can add points to one skill.    
- **Heavy Armor**: resistant to three types of weapons. Its weight is 3, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|price]] is 2x point, and it cannot add points to skills.    

This resistance can manifest in the game in various ways. Either the light armor gets damaged after each successful enemy attack, or the light armor won't protect the character as well. The narrator can decide which method to use, create their own method, or combine multiple methods.

##### Armor Damage

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain type of weapon. After each successful enemy attack, the armor is slightly damaged, reducing the armor points by 1. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the weak armor takes full damage.    
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain type of weapon. Therefore, it does not get damaged during a successful enemy attack. If a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels#Damaging Armor (pacifist)\|victory level]] that directly destroys armor is used, the resistant armor takes only half damage.    
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)    

Damaged armor can be repaired by a blacksmith, or if the character has the appropriate talent and tools, they can repair the armor themselves.

##### Armor Effectiveness

- **Weak Armor**: when the armor is weak against a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 2 armor points block only 1 damage point.    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is weak against the given weapon). The enemy receives 3 damage points.        
- **Resistant Armor**: when the armor is resistant to a certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Basic Weapon Division\|type of weapon]]. In this case, 1 armor point blocks 2 damage points (i.e., the number of damage points is halved, rounded down).    
    - For example: The enemy is supposed to receive 4 damage and has 2 armor (which is resistant to the given weapon). The enemy receives 0 damage points.        
- **Impenetrable Armor**: when the armor blocks all damage. (This type is used when enemies with a significant technological difference are fighting each other, for example, natives attacking tanks.)

##### In Our Universe

In our story universe, armor is divided according to the type of weapon attack it faces (see the list):

###### Against Blunt Weapons and Explosives
- This armor is resistant to blunt weapons and explosives. This means that blunt weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Blunt Weapons\|Blunt Weapons]] are: hammers, maces, clubs, and similar. Also includes blunt throwing weapons.)    
- (Explosives fall under [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Explosive Weapons\|Explosive Weapons]]. These include: grenades, explosive arrows, explosive spells, and similar.)

###### Against Sharp Weapons
- This armor is resistant to sharp weapons. This means that sharp weapons do not harm this armor. 
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Sharp Weapons\|Sharp Weapons]] are: axes, swords, katanas, knives, shurikens, and similar. Also includes sharp throwing weapons.)

###### Against Piercing Weapons
- This armor is resistant to piercing weapons. This means that piercing weapons do not harm this armor.    
- It is weak against other weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.    
- Applies to ranged and stabbing weapons.    
- ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Piercing Weapons\|Ranged Weapons]] are: arrows, bullets—everything shot from a weapon (not throwing weapons).    
- (Stabbing weapons: rapiers, spears, and other weapons designed for stabbing.)

###### Mixed Armor
- A character's armor is "mixed" when they wear pieces of various types of armor on their body.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

 ###### Without Armor
- A character is "without armor" when they have no items or clothing on their body that could be considered armor. Or when it is natural armor, like a turtle's shell.    
- This armor is weak against all types of weapons. This means it loses 1 armor point with each successful enemy attack.

#### Armor and Elements

In our universe, the rule is that every armor is weak against all elements unless it has magical resistance against a particular element.

Regarding elements in general, our story universe follows the rule that all elements are equal. This means that no element is inherently weak against another element.

However, if the narrator wants certain elements to be stronger or weaker against each other (similar to the game Pokémon), they can follow the chapter on "[[RPG - Pocket Monsters#Elements\|Pocket Monsters]]."

#### Energy Armor

This is protection that uses energy (magic or photons) instead of solid materials (such as iron). Energy armor functions similarly to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]. When a character takes damage, their energy armor points are depleted before their health points. Once the energy armor is depleted, the character is no longer protected.

Such armor can also be recharged. The method depends on the story (sometimes a specific item or battery is needed, or if it's magic, the shield is charged from the character's energy through a spell). The narrator sets the limitations of energy armor and its recharging options. The narrator may decide that the armor can be recharged automatically after combat or, in certain cases (using a spell or item), even during combat.

Energy armor does not affect the character's weight. Some weapons may be more effective against it (meaning some weapons deplete 2 or 3 points instead of 1). Some elements may completely ignore it (e.g., a poisonous cloud that depletes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] directly).

In close combat, energy armor functions normally.

#### Magical Armor Abilities

Magical properties of armor are special abilities that provide additional protection or advantage to a character. To activate these properties, the character must meet certain conditions. Some magical properties are activated by spells, or a combination of talent, skill, or specialization. Other magical properties are activated when certain numbers or ranges of numbers are rolled on the dice.

> [!example]
> * **Thorn Armor** - When a 1 is rolled on the dice, the enemy receives as much damage as the number of dice with a 1.
> * **Ice Armor** - Reduces the speed of nearby characters by 1 point (speed) for as many rounds as the character rolled victories.
> * **Spider Armor** - The character can use the "pull" spell. It combines Dexterity + specialization in Spider Armor. The character chooses a target, and the narrator determines the difficulty level.

These magical properties can only be activated when the character has a specialization for a specific type of armor. So if the character has a specialization in heavy armor and is wearing heavy armor with magical properties, they can use the magical properties. If they had a different armor, they could not. The number of points invested in specialization adds dice to the roll or shifts the activation threshold.

- Specialization 1, 2 = when a 1 is rolled    
- Specialization 3, 4 = when a 1, 2 is rolled    
- Specialization 5, 6 = when a 1, 2, 3 is rolled (3 is the maximum)

> [!example]
> For protective properties, numbers 1, 2, 3 are used. For supportive or offensive properties, numbers 4, 5, 6 are used.

As for the cost, magical properties are considered armor points. So if heavy armor has 3 armor points and magical properties add 2 points, the cost will be the same as if the heavy armor had 5 armor points.

In terms of weight, magical properties do not count towards the weight. However, the narrator can change this and, for example, increase the armor's weight.

#### Combat, Attack, and Spells

In our RPG system, battles with monsters follow the same rules as battles with any other characters, with a few modifications.

At the start of the battle, each trainer selects one monster to fight. In each round, the trainer whose monster has the least speed points announces what their monster will do. The trainer whose monster has the most speed points then announces what their monster will do, and can react to the "slower" trainer's decision (which cannot be changed).

Dice are rolled, and the monster with the most successes wins the round. The number of successes the monster rolled is subtracted from the enemy's successes, and the remainder becomes the victory level. Based on this level, the monster deals damage to the enemy.

A monster that loses all health points is out of the battle. The winner (both the monster and its trainer) gains experience equal to the victory amount. The defeated trainer can choose another monster to continue fighting. The winner can also change their monster or choose not to (if they decide not to change, they can use 1 item without affecting the number of actions their monster has in that round).

A trainer with no remaining monsters is out of the battle completely. They are also out if they decide to flee.

>[!info]
>Alternatively, two monsters and the trainer can join the battle to fight side by side.

#### Combat Actions

In each round, a monster can perform one slow action (or two quick actions). If a trainer decides to engage in combat (e.g., using a healing potion), the monster loses one quick action (since each trainer action is a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers#List of Maneuvers\|quick action]]).

Activities involving the use of consumable items (e.g., healing potions or armor-boosting potions) or blessings from the trainer (which have the same effect as potions) can be performed by the trainer before the monster and enemy attacks.

Activities involving switching monsters or purchasing an additional action in combat (where the first attack is considered a supporting roll for the second attack) can only be performed by the trainer after the monster and enemy attacks.

##### Maximum Damage

The rule on maximum damage to the enemy does not apply to monsters.

#### Spell Attributes

Spells in combat are used to damage enemies, defend the monster, restore its points, or gain some advantage. These spells are abilities that the monster knows inherently and do not need to be learned. The only limitations on the number of spells a monster can use are its Evolution and Element. Spells have no weight and do not need to be "equipped" in order to be used (unlike a sword).

In addition to these primary attributes (Evolution and Element), spells also have other attributes, such as weapon type, action type, formula for calculating the number of dice the monster can roll, and the result.

##### Spell Evolution

Evolution limits the spells a monster can use. A monster in Evolution A cannot use spells from Evolution B or C. Conversely, a monster in Evolution C can use spells from Evolution A and B. Evolution also affects the attack calculation and the spell cost.

##### Spell Cost

A monster must sacrifice a few points to use a spell.

- Basic Attack = 0 points    
- Spell Evolution A = 1 point    
- Spell Evolution B = 2 points    
- Spell Evolution C = 3 points

A monster can use wealth points, speed points, and health points to purchase spells. The cost for each spell is fixed and does not change due to points. If a monster lacks sufficient points, it can use the Basic Attack, which replenishes points. (Details on the Basic Attack can be found in the spell list).

##### Spell Element

Each spell must specify the element it is intended for (e.g., water) and may also specify a sub-element (e.g., freezing). If a spell is intended for a specific sub-element, a monster of the main element or a different sub-element cannot use that spell at all.

Exceptions are spells (attacks) that can be used by monsters of all elements. These include the Basic Attack.

##### Weapon Type

In most cases, the weapon type of a spell matches the weapon type of the monster. So if a monster has a blunt melee weapon, its spells will also be blunt melee weapons. Some spells may change this type, but this is rare.

##### Action Type

In the vast majority of cases, each spell and maneuver is a slow action.

>[!note]
>Monsters can use all appropriate maneuvers from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers\|chapter on maneuvers]]. However, they will always be slow actions.

##### Number of Dice

Each spell must specify how to calculate the number of dice the monster can roll.

This number is calculated from the basic attack, which is 3 + "number of dice from the item in the monster's inventory that adds to the attack."

Higher evolution spells can use multiple attributes in their roll.
- Evolution A Spell can use only one attribute, e.g., just STR    
- Evolution B Spell can use two attributes, e.g., just REF and SOC    
- Evolution C Spell can use three attributes, e.g., just STR, REF, and INT    

Higher evolution spells can use an attribute multiple times.

>[!example]
>
>Evolution A Spell ... + 1 x STR
>Evolution B Spell ... + 2 x STR
>Evolution C Spell ... + 3 x STR

###### Choosing Attributes for Spells

Attributes for spells are chosen based on what activity or skill they resemble, or by which point they influence.

For higher evolutions, the choice of attribute depends more on the narrator's intuition, and whether the spell uses only one skill or includes a second or third skill (e.g., whether brute strength also uses agility). Alternatively, the spell may continue to strengthen only one skill.

##### Spell Outcome

A monster can affect either itself, the enemy, or both with its spell.

Each spell can only affect one type of point or combat attribute. Regarding points, a spell can affect Health Points, Speed Points, and Armor. Concerning combat attributes, a spell can affect attack strength, the number of actions per round (each monster can take one slow action, which a spell can reduce or increase), and the number of spells a monster can use (e.g., blocking Evolution C spells even if the monster is of the highest evolution).

Spells can also have passive effects. These activate when a die shows a 1 (for defensive spells) or a 6 (for offensive spells). The strength of the effect depends on the evolution.

- Evolution A Spell can have a very weak passive effect (1 point) that lasts 1 round  
- Evolution B Spell can have a weak passive effect (1 point) activated by a die number, lasting 1 round.    
- Evolution C Spell can have a strong passive effect (1-3 points) activated by a die number, lasting 1 round, or weaker effects (1 point) lasting until the end of the round.    

Spells do not have a status effect (like poison, where a monster loses 1 HP per round). Each spell has an effect that lasts until the next round or until the end of the battle (e.g., poison limits the monster's health points by 1, meaning that point cannot be healed by any spell).

#### Spell Examples

##### For All Elements and Monsters

These spells can be used by monsters of all elements. The monster's element transfers to the attack, meaning if the monster is, for example, fire-elemental, its basic attack will also be fire-elemental. If the monster is water-elemental, its basic attack will also be water-elemental.

###### Basic Attack (All Monsters)

Evolution All (cost 0)    
Element According to the monster's element   
Weapon Type According to the monster's weapon    
Action Slow Action

Dice Roll: 3 dice + item from the monster's inventory that adds to the attack 
Result: Damage to the enemy + restoration of speed points + attack repetition

Description:

The monster attacks the enemy, dealing damage. The monster restores 1 speed point + 1 point for each damage dealt to the enemy (so at least 1).

If a 6 is rolled, the monster can roll again (the number of successes is added to the previous roll's successes).

If two 6s are rolled in the repeated roll, the monster can go again (the number of successes is added to the previous roll).

If three 6s are rolled in the next repeated roll, the monster can roll once more (the number of successes is added to the previous rolls).

And so on.

If the trainer does not have talent in controlling the monster, the basic attack does not lose any dice. However, the monster cannot roll multiple times in succession, even if a 6 is rolled.

The basic attack is also used to calculate the dice roll for all other spells. The rule for restoring speed points applies only to the basic attack.

#### Trainer, Talent, and Specialization

A trainer is a character who owns a monster. They are responsible for training it (according to training rules) and other care (such as healing outside of combat). During combat, the trainer gives commands to their monster, such as which attack to use or when to hide. Additionally, the trainer can add items to the monster's inventory, enhancing its attributes or points. These items can only be added or swapped outside of combat.

Regarding talents and occupations, a trainer must have a talent to utilize their monster effectively. As long as the talent is connected to the monster's primary element (e.g., fire), it automatically applies to sub-elements as well. Occupations are more voluntary and provide the trainer with ways to approach their monster (e.g., a scientist can better identify them, or a doctor can heal them). Occupations are listed separately and are not related to the monster's element.

Specialization works a bit differently. It acts as an inventory where monsters are stored (similar to Poké Balls on a belt). So whenever a trainer captures a monster, they record it in the character table under specializations. Without this, they cannot control the monster.

##### Talent

A trainer needs a talent connected to the primary element of the monster (which automatically applies to sub-elements as well). Without this talent, the monster receives no additional dice from specialization in combat, or (if the narrator decides) the monster loses 2 dice from each roll. Talents apply not only in combat (e.g., when the trainer wants to use a healing item) but also outside it (e.g., when the trainer wants their monster to knock down a tree) or even on other monsters (e.g., when hiding from a wild monster in the forest).

In some activities, talents can be combined. For example, a talent for fire monsters and a talent as a monster healer can be combined when the trainer wants to heal a fire monster.

##### Specialization

In a standard game, specializations are used to enhance the monster, as the number of points the trainer invests in specialization (for a particular monster) increases the number of dice the monster gets in combat. The narrator can decide whether this specialization applies to a specific monster (like Lakti) or to an element or sub-element.

In the LW world, if a trainer wants to own a monster and send it into combat, they must invest 1 point in specialization (it is mandatory). This specialization acts as an inventory where the trainer stores monsters. Whenever the trainer captures a monster, they must deduct 1 point from another skill to invest in the specialization and thus gain the monster.

However, this specialization applies only to that one monster. For example, if a trainer has 10 monsters, they must create a separate specialization for each one (e.g., "Firruzli 1b"). The trainer can also invest additional points in specializations when they level up (gain 1000 experience points), without restriction on where the points are allocated (even if currently fighting with Firruzli and leveling up, they can allocate the point elsewhere, e.g., to Lakti). However, a trainer can invest a maximum of 4 points in one monster.

Specialization adds an extra die for the specified monster in combat.

If the trainer permanently loses a monster, they regain only one point from the specialization (the remaining points are lost).

##### Experience

The trainer gains the same amount of experience as the monster. This experience is equally divided between the trainer and the monster. However, the trainer must reach 1000 points to add another point to the talent or to the monster's specialization.

#### Catching Monsters

The narrator can determine how monsters are captured and under what conditions. However, it's always true that only wild monsters can be caught, not those belonging to another trainer.

In the LW world, there are no balls or other containers. Trainers catch monsters by defeating them (bringing their health points to 0) and then touching them while saying a capture spell. To summon the monster from their soul again, they must say the monster's name and a summoning spell. When the monster is in the soul, time stops for it, as if it ceases to exist until summoned again. This means that to fully heal or change the monster's inventory, the trainer must summon it. Additionally, if the monster is poisoned, its health points do not deplete.

Even when the monster is in the soul, its health, speed points, and wealth slowly regenerate at a rate of 1 point every 24 hours (points regenerate simultaneously, so 1 point for health, speed, and wealth each).

The trainer does not receive any negative statuses from the monster (such as poison or disease). The monster's status is cured after 24 hours in the soul.

If the trainer dies, their monsters disappear.

#### Random Encounters

Random encounters occur in the wild or other abandoned places where wild monsters live. The narrator determines locations where monsters might be found (and their types). When a trainer passes through these locations, they roll for luck.

1. Monster with a level higher by 6
2. Monster with a level higher by 4
3. Monster with a level higher by 2
4. No monster, or a monster with a level lower by 2
5. No monster, or a monster with a level lower by 4
6. No monster, or a monster the trainer wants to catch, or something rare

### Civilizations

The rules concerning civilizations are used when there are multiple factions in the game world. These factions can compete, form alliances, or wage wars. All rules and mechanics that apply to regular characters also apply to civilizations. Of course, there can be exceptions or changes in these rules, and therefore, we will remind you and describe how they differ.

#### Factions

In our RPG system, factions or civilizations include: states, groups, political parties, guilds (e.g., a thieves' guild), religious groups, trade chains, and so on. Factions always have someone who governs them – it can be a god, emperor, king, boss, or even a parliament.

When a character or city is a member of a faction, they gain (or lose) points in attributes, skills, and talents. Each faction has a certain number of points (a certain setup) that applies to them.

>[!info] 
>Specifically :
> -  Attributes: Each faction has two attributes. One attribute has a value of +1 and the other attribute has a value of -1.
> -  And the faction can choose from the following options:
> 	-  Either choose skills, where one skill can have +4 or two skills +2. While one other skill must have -4 or two skills -2
> 	-  Or choose talents, where one talent can have +4 or two talents +2. While one other talent must have -4 or two talents -2 (those that are important in the given world).
> 	-  Or choose spells, where one unique spell can have +4 or two unique spells +2. While one other spell must have -4 or two spells -2 (those that are important in the given world).
> 	- Or combine these options, where the faction can have, for example, one skill +2 and one talent +2. While one spell will have -2 and another skill -2.

#### City Attributes

>[!note]
> Although we write about a city, it also applies to entities like branches and such. So, places where more people work for a civilization or company.

Civilizations are made up of cities. Companies have branches, and organizations have departments. All these cities, branches, and departments are entities that work for their civilization (faction, company, etc.). The civilization, faction, or company itself does not do any work, it only gives orders.

The activities are carried out by the entities (i.e., cities, branches, departments, etc.). Therefore, these entities have their own attributes, just like any other character in our RPG system, following the same rules (though with some exceptions). This means that attributes change the number of dice when rolling for skills, change the number of dice in combat rolls, and also change the number of points the entity (i.e., city, branch, department, etc.) actually has. However, these attributes are adjusted according to the main attribute settings of the faction.

>[!example]
>When a player creates a character that will be part of a faction ruled by the god of war, their attributes at the start of character creation might be set like this:
>
>* plus 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] (strength) and minus 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] (intelligence)
>* plus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] axe fighting and plus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]]
>* minus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]] and minus 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]]
>
> The player can invest points as they wish, but the character has this basic setup.

##### City Size

The size and level of a city are evaluated based on the number of points in its attributes.

> [!example] Example levels and sizes of cities:
>* Settlement - 1, 2, 3
>* Village - 4, 5, 6
>* Town - 7, 8, 9
>* Large City - 10, 11, 12
>* Metropolis - 13, 14, 15
>* and so on.

Whether a city is more of a settlement, village, or large city is mainly important for the story. As for the rules, the level (size) of the city limits the number of points it can improve. Let's imagine that a city has 1 point in all attributes - that is level 1 (in this case a Small Settlement). If the city is at level 1, it can improve a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|Skill]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]] by a total of 1 point. No more. Conversely, if the city is at level 10, it can improve its skills, talents, or specializations by up to 10 points. This means the total number of points in skills, talents, and specializations will be 10.

>[!example]
> - A level 2 Village may not have any skill improved
> - A level 2 Village may have an improved skill such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] 1 (meaning it has improved by 1 point and can improve by 1 more point)
> - A level 2 Village may have improved skills such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] 1 and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] 1 (meaning it has improved by 2 points, which is the maximum)
> - A level 2 Village cannot have an improved skill such as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] 2 and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] 1 (because that is 3 points, while the maximum is 2)

When a city can no longer improve its skills (or talents or specializations), it must improve one of its attributes (to increase its level and be able to improve something else again).

##### City Attributes

Cities can use all basic attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]). When a city receives 1 point in an attribute, it gets:

- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills STR\|strength skills]]        
    - +/- 1 point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]        
    - +/- 1 in weight [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Inventory\|inventory]] ( [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] decreases the total inventory weight)        
- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills REF\|reflex skills]]        
    - +/- 1 in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed points]]        
- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills INT\|intelligence skills]]        
    - +/- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] points in each [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|training roll]]        
- One point in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] adds or subtracts:    
    - +/- 1 die in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|social skills]]        
    - +/- [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/3\|3]] points in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|wealth points]]        
- One point in any attribute:    
    - +/- 1 in combat roll and magic roll        
    - +/- 1 in health points

##### Points and the City

Mestá môžu používať body postavy a to nasledovne.:

Cities can use character points as follows:

- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has 4 health points.            
        - Plus 1 point for each point invested in all attributes.            
    - Health regeneration:        
        - Cities [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Healing injuries\|regenerate]] like characters. A city rolls a regeneration roll during its "turn."            
        - One city can repair another city.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has 4 speed points            
        - Plus 1 for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]]            
    - Usage:        
        - Determines the order in combat or activity.            
        - Cities are constantly in combat in a sense, so combat rules are always followed, even if combat rolls are not made, but rather improvements (i.e., training skills or attributes).     
        - Used to purchase actions during a turn. 2 points allow a city to perform 1 slow action.    
        - (All city actions are slow actions).            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has 4 wealth points            
        - Plus 5 for each point invested in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]            
    - Usage:        
        - These points are used when cities trade with each other.            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]]**:    
    - Number of points:        
        - (Inventory consumes speed points)            
        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] reduces the total weight of the inventory by 1            
        - [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]] adds 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|speed point ]]           
    - Usage:        
        - Items that increase skill points, talents, or specializations can be placed in the inventory. They may also increase basic attack, armor, or points (e.g., health, which is increased through specializations).            
        - Items that increase basic attributes do not exist.            
        - The weight of each item is determined by its price. A brief summary:            
            - If an item adds 1 die = weight 1                
                - (Die for skills and talents)                    
            - If an item adds 1 attack = weight 2                
            - If an item adds 1 armor = weight 3                
        - Armies are not counted in the inventory, as they are considered separate characters (like when a wizard summons a golem).            
- **[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]]**    
    - Number of points:        
        - Each city has armor 1            
        - Plus 1 point for each point invested in STR            
    - Usage:        
        - Reduces the damage that the city receives.            
        - (If the city has negative armor, the attacking enemy reserves victories equal to the negative value).

#### Enhancement

A city gains additional attributes through enhancements. A city can improve its attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]]), skills, talents, specializations, and combat statistics ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|armor]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|attack]]). Points ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health\|health]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Speed\|speed]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth\|wealth]]) can be improved either by enhancing the city's attributes or by enhancing specializations. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] can also be increased through trade.

Each skill and attribute is enhanced according to training rules. For example, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] can only be improved using the skill raw strength. However, an exception applies to cities: cities can enhance one skill using another skill if it can be logically justified. For example, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] can be improved using the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]] if research was conducted in the city to improve the muscle mass of the inhabitants. In such cases, the threshold required to gain 1 point in a skill or attribute is doubled, or the complexity level needed to gain points is doubled.

A city can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] to accelerate its [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|training]]. Each 1 point of wealth adds 1 training point.

#### Items

With the help of items, a city can improve its skills, talents, and specializations, even beyond their maximum level. Items cannot enhance [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]] or city attributes. An item can be bought from another city or the black market (controlled by the storyteller) and placed in the inventory.

>[!example]
> - Field Hospital: talent healer (healing) +2
> - Cannon: attack +3
> - Mobile Generator: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] +1

A city can also "create" items according to the rules of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Items\|item creation]]. The only exception is that a city can use 1 wealth point to gain 1 point for creation (ordinary characters cannot).

Regarding the inventory, each item has its weight (as mentioned above). When the inventory is full (i.e., the city has run out of speed points), the city can no longer place any additional items in the inventory. If a city wants to get rid of its items, it must sell them to another city or destroy them without compensation (which costs 1 slow action). Materials that help in the creation of items (such as steel, oil, gas) are considered a special bundle. This means that one type of material can be placed in the inventory as a bundle that can hold 10 pieces of that material (if the city has several types of materials, they must be placed in separate bundles). Special materials add 1 point to the item creation.

#### City Actions

In a game with civilizations, all activities are considered combat or conflict. Therefore, the game is played according to combat rules. From previous chapters, we know that combat has three phases: declaration of action, execution of action, and result of action. Everything written in that chapter applies, but there are some exceptions.

During the declaration of action, a player selects one city or one army. The order in which cities or armies are selected is determined by the speed points of the civilization (or by rolling dice each round). The order in which city actions are declared is determined by the speed points of the city, not the entire civilization. In battles with armies, the order is determined by the attack value of the army. The fastest army is the one with the lowest attack.

Another exception is that each city can perform only one action per round (each action a city performs is considered a slow action).

Lastly, the result of the action (i.e., dice roll) can mean either damage, reduction of other points (e.g., skills), or creation of an item. It always depends on what is rolled. It doesn't always have to be damage. Cities cannot use the victory level rule for regular characters (cities can damage another city or army, but not disarm them).

##### List of Actions

In the game, an action is considered any activity that ends with a dice roll. This means that activities like negotiation, trading, and overall diplomacy (when cities talk to each other) are not considered actions.

Each city can perform only one action per round. A city can focus on enhancement (according to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Training\|training rules]]), item creation, item destruction, attacking an enemy army, or repairing damage.

>[!note] 
> - If an army attacks a city and that city has already performed another action, it cannot defend against the army.
> - However, a city can defend itself if another city within the civilization has already performed an action.
> - If multiple armies attack a city, the rules for fighting multiple enemies apply (the city rolls its combat roll only once, and each army rolls its roll once. Then the city's roll result is compared to the rolls of all attacking armies).

Each army can perform two actions per round: one movement and one attack (or use of one spell). A round ends for an army whenever it attacks. If the army does not perform any movement, it reserves 1 victory in the attack.

##### Attack, Army, and Armor

The storyteller can decide whether cities will attack each other directly (one city rolls a combat roll and the other city rolls a combat roll). Or they can decide that cities will attack each other with the help of an army that must reach the enemy city to attack it (and may encounter another army on the way).

If the storyteller decides on the first scenario, the city's attack is calculated as _3 + points in all attributes + weapon_ (which the city has in its inventory) and _armor 1_. The player must determine what type of weapon and armor it is, or they can use the elemental system from the chapter on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Monsters from Pocket#Elementy\|magical monsters]].

In the second scenario, the city must create an army. The army is then considered a separate entity as if a wizard summoned a golem, and the creation of the army follows the same rules as when the city creates an item (and the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item price rule\|price rule]] is the same). However, the army has several exceptions. Its attributes are Attack and Armor (and the type of attack and type of armor). The attack also represents health points (i.e., an army with an attack of 2 will have health 2. When damaged, the army's health and attack points decrease). Regarding speed points, an army with a lower attack is considered faster. Lastly, the army cannot hide in its own (or any other) city; it must be outside the city (where it can be repaired by the city, like an item).

##### Diplomacy or Trade

Cities can communicate with each other, express their wants or needs, or even engage in trade. Cities can trade in resources (where one city sells several points of steel to another), manufactured items (where one city sells a generator to another), or services (where one city helps another with repairs or directly with manufacturing or training). Trading itself does not count as an action (this mainly applies to trading resources and products). Trading only counts as an action when it involves services (where one city “produces” several training points for another).

Prices for goods and services are not fixed. It is recommended to use the item price rules, but each city can adjust the price according to its needs.

As for diplomacy, in addition to talking to each other, cities can force others to do something. This involves [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat#Social Combat\|RPG - Combat#Social Combat]] (or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active conflict]]). Alternatively, civilizations can agree to create a large parliament where each civilization has one vote (or where they roll dice against each other for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|SOC]] skills).

#### Map

The storyteller does not have to use a drawn map with a specific number of squares (but if they want to, they can). They can use the distance rule during combat or the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Traveling\|traveling]] rule (where the complexity level derived from the distance converts into the number of rounds the army must overcome to reach its goal).

The terrain is the most important part of the map. Some squares may add dice to the army (or city) or may subtract dice. If the storyteller does not use a drawn map, they can use a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Luck roll\|luck dice]] or a table of randomness.

>[!example]
> 1. Lose 2 dice for all rolls
> 2. Lose 1 die for all rolls
> 3. No dice loss
> 4. No dice loss
> 5. Gain 1 die for all rolls
> 6. Gain 2 dice for all rolls

#### Dice of Chance

When the narrator wants to make their game more interesting or is unsure what to do, they can use a random events table. These can provide answers to questions like:

- What is the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Weather\|weather]] like where the characters are?    
- Who did the characters [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random Encounter\|meet]] while traveling through the forest?    
- What magic is the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/07 ADDITIONAL CONTENT/RPG - Random conflict\|enemy using]]?    
- And many more

To determine a random event, regular dice (D6) are used, where the number on the dice or dice indicates a specific option in the table. All events or options are organized into groups, with the number of options depending on the number of possibilities. The narrator rolls the dice separately. The first die determines the group (i.e., the column in the table), while the second die determines the item in that group (i.e., the cell in the table).

>[!example] 
A roll of 4 and 2 in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Disabling Characteristic\|disadvantage]] table means "Emotional."

The narrator can use:

- The first die to determine the table (e.g., even number and odd number)    
- The second die to determine the column in the table (e.g., column 3)   
- The third die to determine the item (e.g., item 4 in that column)

### Random Encounter

Characters walked through the forest and suddenly encountered an animal... The narrator decides what the characters encounter.

**Whether the encounter is friendly or hostile**

1. Furious enemy who attacks as soon as they see the characters.    
2. Enemy who is cautious but does not attack immediately.    
3. Enemy who is inattentive or sleeping.    
4. Neutral, who can be persuaded for a reasonable price.    
5. Friendly, who can somehow help the characters.    
6. Friendly, like a best friend.
  
**When characters encounter an enemy**

    - (The number of actions the characters take under the influence of the enemy does not change)        
6.  Better impact. The encounter slightly improves the characters' situation.    
    - (The number of actions the characters take under the influence of the enemy decreases by 1) 

**When characters encounter a friendly figure**

1. No benefit. The encounter improves the situation by 5%.    
2. Minimal benefit. The encounter improves the situation by 10%.    
3. Slight benefit. The encounter improves the situation by 25%.    
4. Greater benefit. The encounter improves the situation by 50%.

#### Enemy Attribute Points

During forest or country travel, characters might be attacked by bandits. To save the narrator from worrying about enemy statistics, they can use this list, which categorizes enemies by complexity (tier). The tier determines the number of attribute points the enemy gets. If the narrator can't decide, they can roll a die (in this case, the tier equals the result minus 1).
  
1. 0 points in attributes or skills and no combat talent. The enemy has no weapon.    
2. 1 point in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 1-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
3. 2 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 2-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
4. 3 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 3-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
5. 4 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 4-point weapon or armor (or combination).    
6. 5 points in attributes, skills, or combat talent. The enemy also has a 5-point weapon or armor (or combination).

>[!example]
> - T0 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 0 = 3 dice for attack, armor, or weapon 0 - e.g., cat
> - T1: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 1 = 4 dice for attack, armor, or weapon 1 - e.g., zombie
> - T2: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 2 = 5 dice for attack, armor, or weapon 2 - e.g., bandit
> - T3: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 3 = 6 dice for attack, armor, or weapon 3 - e.g., soldier
> - T4: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]] 4 = 7 dice for attack, armor, or weapon 4 - e.g., general

### Random Weather

Characters were walking through the forest when suddenly it started raining... ? The weather that the characters encounter is determined by the storyteller. They can roll the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Dice of Chance\|chance die]] and choose from the offered options. Or, if they prefer, they can just use it as inspiration.
#### Weather Table

|     |      1 - 2       |      3 - 4       |      5 - 6       |
| :-: | :--------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: |
|  1  |    Snowstorm     |     Drizzle      |  Heavy Snowfall  |
|  2  |     Tornado      |     Very Hot     |   Cold Weather   |
|  3  |     Overcast     |       Dry        |      Sunny       |
|  4  | Pleasant Weather |       Rain       |   Thunderstorm   |
|  5  |   Party Cloudy   | Pleasant Weather |      Storm       |
|  6  |     Very Hot     |   Strong Wind    | Natural Disaster |

##### Weather Severity

When the storyteller determines the weather, they can roll dice to see how much the weather affects the characters.

1. Huge impact. The weather worsens the characters' situation significantly. By 150%.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather increases by 4)        
2. Great impact. The weather worsens the characters' situation considerably. By 100%.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather increases by 3)        
3. Greater impact. The weather worsens the characters' situation more. By 50%.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather increases by 2)        
4. Slight impact. The weather worsens the characters' situation slightly. By 25%.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather increases by 1)        
5. No impact. The weather does not worsen the characters' situation at all.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather does not change)        
6. Better impact. The weather slightly improves the characters' situation.    
    - (The CL of activities performed by the characters under the influence of the weather decreases by 1)

### Random World

The narrator might find themselves needing to quickly create a new world or at least its dimension. If they're unsure about how exactly the world should function or look, they can use the following rules and tables.

#### Three Story Dice

If the narrator has so-called "story dice," they can use those to build the world. Simply roll 1 to 3 dice for each category (in the list below).

- Dice for the world (what it is, how it looks)    
- Dice for advantages (friends, good things, helpful elements, friendly animals, plants, objects)    
- Dice for disadvantages (enemies, harmful elements, poisonous things)

**The narrator can also roll the dice to determine what the characters need to do to succeed:**

1. Activate a mechanism, repair it, or just find it and understand it
2. Move, push, throw something, or use physical force
3. Attack the enemy, avoid the enemy, or deceive the enemy
4. Think, solve a puzzle, or learn something
5. Overcome fear, break their principles, break the law
6. Swim, cut down a tree, climb a mountain

**The narrator can also decide which element will be present in the given world:**

1. Fire, something hot, in a volcano
2. Water, something cold, underwater
3. Earth, something solid or crystal-related, underground
4. Air, something pressurized (like air pressure), in the sky
5. Electricity, something related to technology, possibly forgotten technology
6. Plants, something related to life, within an organism

**Or, if the narrator doesn't want to choose between elements, they can decide which color of magic will be used in the given world:**

1. Brown = rot, fungi, mold, disease
2. Gray = elements
3. Green = plants
4. Red = organics, body transformation
5. Blue = spirits, soul, psyche
6. White = energy, physical phenomena

**And if the narrator decides to use magic, they can also determine the level of that magic:**

1. Primitive = like the Stone Age
2. Common = at the level we have in our world
3. Exceptional = at the level of our world, but scientists are still working on it
4. Rare = at the level of futurism stories in the not-so-distant future
5. Very rare = at the level of Sci-Fi stories, but something that can still be physically explained
6. Legendary = like fairy tales

**Lastly, the narrator can roll the dice to determine where the characters will start their story in the new world:**

1. By a river, sea, or lake
2. In the mountains, on cliffs, somewhere high
3. In a city, village, or settlement
4. On a road between cities
5. In a meadow, field, or somewhere outside of civilization
6. Deep in a forest or jungle

### Random conflict

The narrator might find themselves needing to quickly create a conflict in their story. They can follow the suggestions below or choose from the following tables using the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/02 DICE/RPG - Dice of Chance\|Dice of chance]].

#### World / Republic / Story

Roll a die to determine what stands against each other in the conflict:

1. [[Elements\|Elements]] (e.g., fire against water)    
2. [[Color of Magic\|Color of Magic]] (e.g., plants against decay)    
3. Size (e.g., dwarves against giants, or man against corporation)    
4. [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]] against technology or fairy tales against knowledge    
5. Time (past against future)    
6. Mixed conflict (e.g., small plants against large technology)

#### Type of Conflict or Obstacle

When the narrator doesn't know what obstacle the characters face or what the conflict entails, and how the characters can resolve it:

#### Group No. 1 (When the Die Rolls 1 or 2)

##### Column - 1 - 

###### Item 1 - Underworld

In this world, there is an underworld where beings go when they die. The way a being dies is reflected in its appearance – for example, it may wander around with a severed head. Beings can escape from this underworld or find employment there or do other work. If a being leaves the underworld without being employed (meaning it didn't find a job there), it is stuck in the place where it died, for example, it cannot leave a house – it simply cannot. However, it can return to the underworld. The being is always a ghost – an ugly creature that controls unique magic based on its state and can decide whether to help or harm others.

###### Item 2 - Diary

In this world, there exists a diary. When someone writes a name, manner, and time into it – the being will die exactly as written. This diary is managed by the spirit of death, who is bored and thus created the diary. The spirit enjoys playing with people and the diary owners.

Another variant of the diary could be a diary of fate, where the being can change the fate of others (for example, turn someone's victory into a loss). Or it could be a diary of sins, where the being sees all the sins of all beings (especially the one it is looking at). Or this diary could be a list of demons – where the being finds a demon of interest and the demon fulfills its wish, of course, for a price.

###### Item 3 - Dreams

In this world, there exists technology that allows one to enter another being's dream. This technology is used either as a therapeutic tool for a psychologist or as a tool for stealing ideas. When someone enters the dream world, they are at the mercy of the logic of the dream, which is determined by the dreamer (for example, gravity might work strangely there, they might breathe underwater, or the dream might completely change the characters – turning them into fireflies). The one who entered the dream must avoid changing and must maintain their own shape at all times. They must, of course, not die. They can wake up on their own, at any time (and even if the dreamer wakes up, no one dies).

###### Item 4 - 10-year-old from Home

Craftsmen, wizards, scientists, or a certain type of beings have a rule in this world. When they reach the age of 10, they must leave their home for 20 years. During their journey around the world, they must improve in their craft (and of course, they must survive, find work, etc.).

###### Item 5 - Aliens

In this world, there are aliens who crashed there by sheer accident. These aliens were taken by the government for study to learn as much as possible about them and use their technology. More aliens may come, or they may not. The discovery of the aliens can be kept secret, or it may not.

###### Item 6 - Music and Emotions

In this world, magic (or technology) is powered by music and emotions. That is the main magical force (or electricity). Alternatively, the whole world functions on some kind of music (and emotions changes effect of the music ).

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 1 - Sunken

A catastrophe occurred and in this world, most of the land is permanently submerged (or affected by another element). The beings have already adapted to the new life and continue as best as they can (basically rebuilding the same society - of course with limitations). Now treasure hunters venture into the ruins of the old world to dig out treasures from the past era (or take whatever they find useful).

###### Item 2 - Strange Laws

The world has strange laws, whether they be physical, chemical, or other natural laws. For example, a person might be able to walk on the ceiling. From white walls, bird chirping might be heard (the wall is, of course, solid). The environment might contain small cubes that can be manipulated (e.g., collected and stacked using some tool to create a uniform surface). The laws of this world have their own logic, but compared to our world, they are completely strange.

###### Item 3 - Castle

In the clouds of this world, there is a flying castle (or some fortress), which is abandoned and no one has ever been there. It might be a remnant of an old civilization, or a new civilization might have arrived. This castle hides a power that can change the whole world. Whether for better or worse, depends on who finds the castle.

###### Item 4 - Angels and Demons

In this world, there exist religious beings - angels and demons, who fight against each other. The beings of this world use them for their own purposes.

###### Item 5 - Monsters

Monsters (such as vampires) live in this world, and they have their own way of life. These monsters may have built a society. How they influence the beings of this world depends on the author. But monsters always have to affect the inhabitants in some way.

###### Item 6 - Sport

In this world, there is one sport that is incredibly popular, to the point that the entire world revolves around it - parliament passes laws for this sport, beings learn it in schools and universities, and even industries create things for this sport (e.g., unreal tournament).

##### Column - 3 -

###### Item 1 - PC World

Beings can transfer themselves into a computer world with the help of a machine that digitizes them. In the computer world, the same rules apply to them as to programs.

###### Item 2 - Mega City

In this world, there is one large and mega-dense city that looks like a cube from the outside, but inside it's a mish-mash of roads, buildings, and other things a city needs. And the city has both old buildings (ancient shrines) and new buildings.

###### Item 3 - Exists

In this world, there are stories that are read to children or series that are broadcast on TV. But one story that is broadcast, even though it is fiction, actually exists; it's just that no one knows.

###### Item 4 - Gods

In this world, gods exist. These gods interfere with the lives of beings according to what the gods represent. For example, the goddess of love manipulates love, creating love triangles. The gods in this world can communicate directly with the beings they choose and can grant these beings unique magic (other beings don't have this magic, only blessed beings do).

###### Item 5 - From Dimension

The world was invaded by beings from another dimension who can jump between dimensions and stop time. So the beings from the invaded dimension started to defend themselves and at the same time began to look for an artifact that would stop the invaders. However, the artifact is located in other dimensions, so these defending beings decided to jump to other dimensions of the multiverse.

These beings (who are defending) exist only thanks to quantum computers that remember their existence. And if these computers don't remember something, it ceases to exist. Therefore, during a jump, they might lose an arm.

These beings must be connected to their world (or base) with a cable (the cable travels with them and looks more like an antenna). If they lose the cable, they will be forever trapped in the other dimension or disappear. 

###### Item 6 - Fungus

A catastrophe occurred in the world that caused a toxic fungus to spread across the world, killing everything it touches and transforming all nature and animals beyond recognition. This fungus creates a toxic jungle that can only be survived by animals and plants that have mutated there. (When someone kills an animal, it starts to rot, and the jungle spreads).

##### Column - 4 -

###### Item 1 - Broken

This world is broken, like a cup. There are shards of the old world and places of nothingness (as if there were black holes). The world is literally broken - for example, a building might be split in half. Information can also be broken, the world might be missing a part of its magic (which it must have had), or beings don't have names, or they have only certain animals.

###### Item 2 - Labyrinth

The whole world is one big labyrinth with many dead ends. This can be literal, meaning the cities are designed this way, or it can be metaphorical, where the rules and social structure are so incredibly complex that they are like a labyrinth.

###### Item 3 - Court

In this world, there is one large court that decides on important matters. At this court, almost anything can be filed, and its decision is binding for everyone (and everyone respects it).

###### Item 4 - Flame

In this world, one can be infected by a demonic flame. It's a fire that can infect any being, just by touching the flame (or an infected being). The infected being burns, and the fire gradually spreads until it completely engulfs the being. And then, this being desires only to destroy all living things until it finally dies in terrible pain. A person can be freed from the fire only by another god or they must cleanse themselves somehow.

###### Item 5 - Necronomicon

In this world, there exists an evil that can be summoned by a book (someone just needs to read the activation spell). This evil is murderous and wants to destroy the world. The book contains several spells that can cause harm, destruction, and summon the dead.

###### Item 6 - Heroes

In this world, there are heroes who have their unique spells, which they use in battles against other factions.

In this world, three factions fight, influenced by three main forces:
- Red: Strength    
- Blue: Mind    
- Green: Agility (each hero has different levels of these forces)    

Heroes improve their abilities with items and by combining them into stronger artifacts.

##### Column - 5 -

###### Item 1 - Bosses

This world is divided by powerful bosses. Each one has a different personality, a different style of ruling, different abilities, and a different worldview. One, for example, could be a banker who sees everything through the lens of money. Another could be a scientist conducting experiments.

Each of them demands absolute obedience (for different reasons, e.g., one for survival, another behaves like a mobster). Each of these bosses owns a part of the world adapted to their profession (e.g., the scientist's area looks like a lab). The bosses hate each other. Whether they can tolerate each other depends on circumstances and whether they need each other. Otherwise, they are in constant war.

###### Item 2 - War

In this world, a massive war is taking place, and everything (industry, schools, art) is subordinated to this war.

###### Item 3 - Superhero Factory

In this world, superheroes can be created. It is a difficult and long process during which many people die, but in the end, someone with superpowers emerges. The purpose of these heroes is determined by the storyteller.

###### Item 4 - Drug

In this world, there exists a drug—something that a person needs, which gives them great advantages, but it also destroys them, turning them into a monster, and they can't live without it. This drug is rare—hard to find, and often someone has to be killed to get it.

###### Item 5 - Nightmare

In this world, there exists endless and indestructible evil that can materialize fear, i.e., what a being is afraid of. This evil transforms every dream into a nightmare, where it wants to imprison the being forever. However, there are warriors who fight against this nightmare by jumping into the unfortunate person's dream and freeing them. They find the exit or defeat a demon (created by the being's fear, e.g., a giant spider).

###### Item 6 - Transmutation

In this world, there exists magical alchemy that can combine multiple elements (or objects) into one. Matter first turns into energy, and it merges. This fusion is difficult, so the being must learn it well. In alchemy, the law of equivalent exchange applies, meaning the cost of fusing an object must be balanced by raw materials (and energy or the life of the character). They use magical diagrams for alchemy, where they place raw materials and start the reaction with their magical energy. Alchemists can only create what they have knowledge and raw materials for (e.g., a granite sword from a granite floor). Some of them serve the army, others are terrorists, or scientists studying alchemical fusion.

##### Column - 6 -

###### Item 1 - Asteroids

In space, there are asteroids that host various living (and non-living) biomes. They are enormous, seeming like they were ripped from a planet. They have cores made of liquid lava, flowing water, other elements, metal, sand, etc. Humans decided to teleport a few workers there to cultivate the asteroids and create a livable environment. These workers now have to struggle through hardships, fight with fauna, flora, lack of food, water, air—everything—because they must survive and prepare the asteroid for colonization.

###### Item 2 - God of Good and God of Evil

The gods of good and evil decided to end their battle by organizing games, in which chosen contestants fight for their side (good or evil).

###### Item 3 - Blood Magic

Magic or technology in this world is powered by blood. For example, when a character wants to create a fireball, they must use their own blood for it. (Modifications are up to the author, spells can look bloody or not).

###### Item 4 - Multi-Weather

In this world, there are multiple climate zones in one place. For example, one city might have winter with snow, another, a kilometer away, might have a desert, and a third might be a jungle.

###### Item 5 - Inverted World

The world is broken into floating islands that orbit the sun. The problem is that the sun is "down" and gravity pulls "down" as well. Thus, the illuminated parts of the islands are on the bottom, while the upper parts are dark with eternal night.

Living on the bright sides is extremely difficult because gravity pulls objects towards the sun, not the island. And the bottom part of the island has no floor or ground to catch a being.

Living on the dark sides is also difficult because of eternal darkness, but the island catches objects (so gravity works as expected in our world).

###### Item 6 - Mechanical Fortress

A mechanical castle roams the world. It has legs like a spider and doors that allow teleportation to any other door. The owner of this castle is involved in various societal changes and is sought after for their endless possibilities.

#### Group No. 2 (when a 3 or 4 is rolled)

##### Column - 1 -

###### Item 1 - Organization

In this world, there is a secret organization that either protects people from a hidden threat or consists of villains who want to achieve something secretly.

###### Item 2 - Isolated

The place is isolated from the world (planets, worlds). The characters crashed there on some vessel and can only leave with that vessel. They cannot call for help or request reinforcements—they only have each other and what is on the vessel.

###### Item 3 - Action Reaction

In this world, every action (activity, thought) has a reaction that works in the opposite direction. What kind of reaction depends on the world's setting. If it’s a dystopia, then it might be negative, or it could be determined by rolling dice.

###### Item 4 - Underground

In this world, there exist underground tunnels and catacombs built by monsters. These monsters are led by a demigod who communicates with the underground through a large heart. In this underground, the monsters have everything they need—food, entertainment, gold, and weapons. They emerge from the underground to terrorize the surroundings.

###### Item 5 - Transformation

When someone enters this world, they begin to change physically and mentally. For example, a being might enter a world of cats and gradually transform into a cat.

###### Item 6 - Young Gangs

In this world, there is a poor district that is the center of violence. Here, children learn to survive. Eventually, they join armed gangs that use them to transport drugs (or other criminal activities) and for bloody battles. (This could also be a district under the influence of a religious cult or the army).

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 1 - Guardian of Technology

In this world, advanced technologies are widely used, but they have their own intelligence and sometimes go crazy. Policemen or specially trained guardians come to tame this technology.

###### Item 2 - One Decides

In the world, there are several miraculous characters, but none is as powerful as one character who can change the universe with a single thought. After all, she created everything here, even the miraculous beings, without knowing it. This one powerful character rewrites the entire universe whenever she gets bored. To prevent her from accidentally destroying the entire universe, the miraculous characters must entertain her. Of course, they must not tell her anything.

###### Item 3 - Autopilot

In this world, there are cars (or other vehicles) that are intelligent and can drive without a driver. Therefore, no one learns to drive (since there’s no need).

###### Item 4 - Blessed

In this world, there are gods or demons who, for a price or service, grant beings magic or technology that others can only dream of. However, not everyone is worthy of the blessing. Both gods and demons choose (each according to their taste and rules). Some gods and demons fight against each other, others entertain themselves and play with people's lives, and some build something (e.g., their own utopia).

###### Item 5 - Incarnation

In this world, there are a few beings who have perfect memory of all their past (or future) lives. This memory activates at a certain age (e.g., 15) or is unlocked through a ritual. These beings know everything they did in all their past lives (or future lives), what happened to them, and how they died. Some use this knowledge for good, others for evil.

###### Item 6 - Religious

In the world, there is faith, religion, and priests. God exists (communicating either with people or priests), and priests can perform the magic of the god (or his miracles), and all rituals work precisely (for example, a ritual that is meant to cleanse a soul literally cleanses the soul). In this world, all problems are solved through faith and god.

##### Column - 3 -

###### Item 1 - Trick

In this world, magic does not exist. Everything is just a trick achieved through physical laws, mirrors, light, and fog. Each trick depends on the magician's skill and the audience's gullibility.

###### Item 2 - Fairy Tale

In this world, things happen as in classic fairy tales. They might have similar (or the same) stories, plots, characters, and conflicts. For example, like Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf.

###### Item 3 - Combat Cooking

In this world, when chefs want to cook something, they must first hunt and kill it. Therefore, chefs are also hunters of various monsters, whose meat (or plant matter) is highly prized, but it spoils quickly and cannot be preserved (only cooked).

Chefs can also compete in their craft.

###### Item 4 - Races

In this world, conflicts are resolved through races or sports that the whole world plays. For example, instead of war, a game of Tetris takes place. These races are bloody (for example, with Tetris - players are on a large field, and stone blocks fall on them that they must arrange). The results of the races are binding for everyone.

###### Item 5 - Mafia Rules

In this world, the mafia is the main government, ruling almost like a normal state. Of course, in a mafia style, because mafia crime is legal. Fighting for the old law (i.e., laws that prohibit crime like in our world, I hope) is illegal for the mafia.

###### Item 6 - Our World

The world in which the story takes place is similar to ours, but with some changes.

##### Column - 4 -

###### Item 1 - Video Games

The story takes place in the world of video games, where everything works according to the logic of video games. Whatever is in the program applies.

###### Item 2 - Hunter

The beings of this world are being hunted by someone. Either a higher being comes to hunt the inhabitants of this world for fun or for another reason.

###### Item 3 - Yin and Yang

In this world, the line between good and evil is thin. Every evil thing contains something good (a maniacal ruler protects the country and there is no hunger, but he kills people because they are different or disagree with him), and in every good thing, there is something evil (saving a person who then causes someone else's death just by existing, for example, because they are radioactive).

The decisions of the beings are also not purely good or evil—they might be better in some ways and worse in others.

Do I kill a creature that has poisoned the nearby area?

If yes, loggers will have a place to cut wood, and the village will prosper, but I will kill an intelligent and unique being.

If I don’t kill the creature? The village will starve because the loggers won’t have a place to cut wood, or it won’t sustain everyone.

###### Item 4 - Reassembled

This world was destroyed, as if broken into cubes. As characters move through the world, it reconstructs itself under their feet. As if the cubes fly from nothingness under their feet to create land, buildings, etc. And when the beings leave that place, the cubes return to nothingness.

###### Item 5 - Many Times

In this world, there are places where times converge. The past, present, and future coexist there simultaneously.

###### Item 6 - Invincible

In this world, there exists an invincible hero (or enemy) who can defeat anyone, destroy anything, and kill everything.

##### Column - 5 -

###### Item 1 - Remote

The given place is as remote as if it were on another planet—extremely far from home (or another main civilization). The home planet sent people to this very remote place to colonize it, and they succeeded.

###### pol. 2 - Mahou shoujo

In this world, girls (or boys) can make a contract to have one wish granted—but then they must fight against giant demons. These magical warriors do not have their souls connected to their bodies, but to a stone (which they wear as jewelry). They use this stone to transform from a normal state to a magical state (where they have access to all their unique spells and weapons).

###### Item 3 - Dual

There are two versions of the world with similar histories. They are dimensions that started the same but developed completely differently. For example, one side won World War in one, while the other side won in the other. In one world, the main character (or someone significant) is a hero, and in the other, a villain. Some beings can travel between these dual dimensions.

###### Item 4 - Simulation

The entire world is just a simulation, a massive software/hardware system to which all beings are connected, living their own lives within it. The surrounding world is entirely different, and the reasons for the simulation also vary. However, the beings have no idea.

The problem with the simulation is that due to limited memory, it can only simulate for half a year before the server needs to restart (which resets time). During this process, all beings' memories are erased. At least, that's how it's supposed to work.

Or, the entire world was destroyed by aliens. However, the aliens need the beings (for some reason), so they created a replica of the world (or part of it) on their alien planet. The entire replica is controlled by aliens—who can even modify and change it at night.

###### Item 5 - Bus

In this world, everything is extremely far apart, and all roads lead through dangerous places. Therefore, some beings earn their living by transporting goods and others to various locations.

###### Item 6 - Enhancement

In this world, a being can install something—a device—into themselves that improves them. They might get a robotic arm, a chip, or even a parasite that gives them magical abilities.

##### Column - 6 -

###### Item 1 - Underworld Evil (Pessimistic)

In this story, there exists a second world - the underworld - where people go after death. This world has its own rules (like our normal one), but it is pessimistically inclined, similar to hell. People suffer there, even if they were good during their lives. Demons drag spirits into this second world, delighting in their suffering. Souls in the second world are immortal and suffer forever. Sometimes they are released into the normal world as ghosts to do some task, but once the task is completed, the demons take them back and continue torturing them.

###### Item 2 - Mega Hero

In this world, there exists a mega hero who can solve even the most difficult cases. He is a walking army in one man, seemingly immortal and indestructible. However, he has a small army of helpers who work, fight, think, and clean for him, though he receives all the glory.

###### Item 3 - Phobia

What a being fears materializes in the most terrifying form.

###### Item 4 - Nature Advances

The world (or part of it) was destroyed by a catastrophe. The beings from these places disappeared, either died or fled. Nature returned to these places, struggling to survive there. Trees, grass grow again, and animals have arrived. It looks like a forest, but buildings from the past and many dangers (such as poison or radioactivity) still remain.

###### Item 5 - Animals and Humans

In this world, there are multiple races. Not only human, but also animal races that have their own societies, languages, economies, etc. They cooperate, trade, but can also fight with humans and other animal species.

###### Item 6 - Slaves

In this world, slavery exists, where one group of inhabitants is enslaved and forced to do hard labor for free. The inhabitants are enslaved for some reason—maybe because of how they were born (like in the movie Planet of the Apes), or because the wealthy beings own water, and the enslaved must earn it. Or it could be because some are intelligent, while others are uneducated (e.g., they can't operate complex machines or use magic).

#### Group No. 3 (when a 5 or 6 is rolled)

##### Column - 1 -

###### Item 1 - Secret Club

In this world, there is a secret club where members fight each other or use monsters to fight against each other and so on. This bloody sport is not done because the members hate each other but to stave off boredom or earn money. This club has its own rules, the members know each other, and maybe they have some rituals. However, they exist in strict secrecy.

###### Item 2 - Alternative

In this world, there exists an alternative to, for example, medicine, newspapers, or magic—these alternatives are widespread, people believe in them, and use them in their daily lives. The problem is that these alternatives are promoted by charlatans, they harm, and can even kill beings. But the beings do not believe this; they only believe in the alternative things and claim that the main (traditional) thing is harmful.

###### Item 3 - Guardian of Action

In this world, there is magic that guards a certain action. For example, a goddess of commerce who protects every transaction, and if someone lies or deceives a trader during a transaction, they receive a terrible punishment.

###### Item 4 - One Person

In this world, there lives one person who has experienced everything—for example, they fought in the First World War and the Second. They saw the cities being built. This person remembers everything and cannot be killed.

###### Item 5 - Submarines

In this world, travel is conducted by submarines that can dive into water, earth, lava (depending on the story). Without them, people cannot travel, trade, or transport goods. People live in enclosed complexes (because around them there is water or another element through which the submarines travel).

###### Item 6 - Contract

In this world, there exists a mysterious contract that beings can make with immortal demons. This deal is risky and has its consequences.

A being can choose one wish that the demon must fulfill. However, in exchange for this advantage, the being must bind themselves to the demon. Their souls merge, and the demon slowly begins to drain the being's life, who will die much sooner.

The demon gains a physical form, allowing them to live in the world among humans. They can transform into their demonic form, which is invincible, but during this transformation, the demon will drain the being much faster.

The nature of the relationship depends on the type of contract. The being and the demon can fight together against someone else. Or the being can become the demon's slave, carrying out its orders.

##### Column - 2 -

###### Item 1 - Dark Lord

In this world, a cruel dark lord once ruled, who was defeated and sent to the underworld by a hero. However, his servants are trying to bring him back at any cost.

###### Item 2 - Control

In this world, there are beings who can control the elements that make up the entire world. Either through dance, martial arts, or other movements. They can control these elements but not create them—the element must be nearby.

###### Item 3 - Revival of the Monster

In a secret location, an experiment was conducted to revive a long-extinct monster or species of monsters (like dinosaurs). However, the experiment got out of control, and everyone who could, fled. Now the monsters are doing whatever they want.

###### Item 4 - Caste

In this world, people are divided into castes or groups. For example, they are divided by occupation (miners, engineers...), by role (guards, workers, scholars), or by whether they can use magic or not. Children born to parents in a certain caste must work in the same job as their parents.

###### Item 5 - Seers

In this world, there are seers who can see the future. The further into the future, the more hazy it is. So they see the near future much more clearly. Special offices use seers to prevent crimes (or for other purposes).

###### Item 6 - Twins

Every being has a twin born somewhere else. These twins have a slight awareness of each other—knowing if the other is alive or in danger. Various rules can apply to twins; for example, if one dies, the other turns into a demon. Or twins must always choose the same profession, otherwise, they will not succeed. Or twins must stay far apart, or they will die.

##### Column - 3 -

###### Item 1 - Great Empire

In this world, there is a great empire that spans several continents. Despite this, the empire strives to conquer and enslave more and more new territories.

###### Item 2 - Time Travel

In this world, time travel is possible. One can go to the past to fix something in the present or go to the future to see how their decisions will change the entire planet. Time travel can be achieved with the help of a time machine, which requires specific fuel and high speed.

###### Item 3 - Morphs

In this world, there are "morphs". These are creatures that infect the living (or dead) and turn them into monsters. These monsters then kill others. From the completely destroyed bodies, a substance emerges that spreads like an infection, modifying the destroyed bodies into weapons or organs that do something else. It's all part of a large organism that just consumes.

Morphs can be of any element or origin. They can be fungi, plants, sweets, or metal.

###### Item 4 - Colony

Beings came to this world for a single purpose: to colonize it. They only have basic survival items, essentially no roads, just some tents, and they struggle to survive. They must live mainly off nature, which provides everything but not for free.

###### Item 5 - Plant Demons

In this world, there are demons that use thick, creeping plants to achieve their goals. These plants are unnatural—they embody horror itself. Besides having eyes, they kill people. These monsters can only be destroyed by destroying their core (such as a crystal heart).

###### Item 6 - You Won't Age Here

In the world, there is a place where no one ages. When a being comes to this place, their biological time stops.

##### Column - 4 -

###### Item 1 - Virus

An unknown deadly virus has almost wiped out all beings. The survivors moved underground because it is the only safe place. They only go to the surface when they need something.

###### Item 2 - Only Discoveries

In this world, most problems have been solved, so the beings set out on a great journey through space (or worlds) to find new planets, elements, civilizations, and form alliances. Civilizations that are not ready for this are only observed by the beings, waiting for them to evolve. Yes, even in this world there are wars, but only between stubborn civilizations or those that want to assimilate everything for themselves.

###### Item 3 - Immortal

The main hero or a selected group of beings never dies, no matter what happens to them. The heroes indulge in horror-related things (studying monsters, pathology), are surrounded by creepy things, and overall do not fit into the given world. Everyone would like to exclude them from society, but they cannot because this selected group is useful, albeit eccentric.

###### Item 4 - Mafia

In this world, there is organized crime that is run like a business (selling weapons, drugs, using prostitution and gambling). The mafia is divided into families, each with its own boss who manages everything. These mafia families can be at war with each other or at peace, but each has its own visual style and way of ruling (e.g., Chinese mafia looks and behaves differently from Italian mafia).

###### Item 5 - Different World

This world has a completely different shape. It can be flat, like a cube, or like a cylinder. This world can be fragmented (islands floating in the air) or hollow (like our planet being hollow) and so on.

###### Item 6 - Boring Work

This world is full of routine and boredom. Everything is the same, everything works the same, and nothing deviates from the schedule. Even the work is monotonous and boring.

##### Column - 5 -

###### Item 1 - Forgotten

In this world, there exists magic, technology, craft, or place that has been forgotten how it works. Beings have gotten used to just using whatever is magical, and it somehow works. They don't know anything more about it and don't bother with it.

###### Item 2 - Fragments

In this world, there are certain fragments that, with the help of the last fragment, will unite and defeat a great evil.

###### Item 3 - Organism

The entire world is one big organism, with inhabitants serving as workers (like erythrocytes in a body). The organism can be organic or mechanical, and every part of the organism works solely for its survival.

###### Item 4 - Mask

In this world, there exists a magical mask that gives the wearer incredible strength. The mask brings out all the buried and suppressed qualities of the being. An extremely introverted being who loves comics becomes a superhero operating according to comic book logic.

###### Item 5 - School

Children attend a large school where they learn everything necessary about the world, history, and mathematics. Whether it’s a magical school, a military school, a school for video games, or technology, the storyteller decides.

###### Item 6 - Airships

Beings do not live on the surface of the earth but in airships or flying fortresses.

##### Column - 6 -

###### Item 1 - Underworld Good

In this story, there exists a second world to which people go after death. This world has its own rules (like our normal world), but it is optimistically inclined, similar to heaven. Evil people are in prison in this world.

###### Item 2 - Gladiators

In this world, there is a bloody gladiatorial sport where beings fight to the death. They might fight animals or have to go through some obstacle course.

###### Item 3 - Parasite and Medicine

In this world, there exists a very necessary medicine. However, this medicine is obtained by inserting a terrible parasite into a being, which drains their life and mentally destroys them.

###### Item 4 - Mega Corporations

Mega corporations have divided the entire world. Governments or states do exist, but they essentially have no power or are subordinate to the corporations. These corporations own a lot of land and beings, whom they can command. They exploit, manufacture—without regard for the planet. Corporations own the police, the army, and healthcare—everything.

###### Item 5 - Split World

The world has split into two mirror parts. One is in complete contrast to the other (if it is light in one, it will be dark in the other).

###### Item 6 - Riddle

The world is falling into ruin (or has a big problem), and the only thing that can save it is solving a riddle. It could be a text, a mathematical formula, or a treasure map. At the end is the solution to all the problems.
