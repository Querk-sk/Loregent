<div style="text-align:center; "><h2>From Author</h2></div>

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] is designed for playing and 'experiencing' various stories. I use it for writing, which hopefully makes my stories at least a bit more original. Because that's the main goal - to write and experience the best stories possible, right?

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] consists of four books. This book you are reading is the RPG System, which deals with the rules of the role-playing game. Another book contains the story universe with planets and worlds where all our stories take place (although the universe is not necessary for your game, it can be an interesting inspiration for you). Another book is dedicated to magic, not only the system but also directly contains magical sciences that you will find in our stories. Finally, there are books that contain modules - stories that you can play directly. And last but not least, books with stories we have written.

It is important for you to know that this [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] project is labeled as 'unstable'. This means that there will be frequent changes. So if you want to use our system to write a series of books or create a major campaign, you might want to wait. However, you can still write a short story or play a micro campaign.

### Cogent Roleplay

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] was created by translating and modifying [Cogent Roleplay](https://cogentroleplay.com/) version 1, written by Josiah Brooks ([Jazza](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHu2KNu6TtJ0p4hpSW7Yv7Q )) and Shad Brooks ([Shadiversity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmMACUKpQeIxN9D9ARli1Q)). So [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/LoreGent\|LoreGent]] is a project "Powered by Cogent".

If you want, I recommend you to visit Cogent roleplay, or its community version: [CogentRoleplayCommunity Â· GitHub](https://github.com/CogentRoleplayCommunity).
