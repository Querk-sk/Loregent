### Cost of Magic

In our RPG system, every magic and every spell has its cost.

The hidden or indirect cost lies in the character's attributes, as every character wanting to use their magic safely must invest points into their magical talent or specialization. Another, slightly less hidden cost is the complexity level of the given spell. Lastly, magic is directly paid for in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]].

If a character does not "pay" the cost of magic, they cannot cast spells at all, or their casting will have serious consequences in case of failure.

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]] are necessary for casting spells, and without them, a character cannot cast. Each character has [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6 points]], which can be increased by investing points into the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]] attribute. In short, the cost of spells can be summarized as follows: every [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spell costs 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Energy\|Points of Energy]], and every [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]] spell costs 2 points. (More on this topic can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Energy\|relevant section]].)

Points in talents or specialization, mentioned in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Basics of Magic\|basics of magic]] section, increase the number of dice the character can use in their magical roll. This increases the chances of not failing the roll or saving time needed for casting (because if the complexity level is too high, the character may have to roll multiple times. More details can be found in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat Maneuvers#Spell Charging - f\|combat maneuvers]] section.)

There are several options for the complexity level, each of which the narrator can adjust as they see fit.

#### Spell Challenge Level

The Challenge level is the threshold that a character must overcome in their dice roll. If they do not pass the threshold, the spell is not created, or something worse may happen (see the section on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Spellcasting Failure\|spellcasting failure]]). The Challenge level is not fixed—meaning the narrator can choose from several options. They can set the cost based on the level of magic, what the spell can do, set the Challenge level as the cost of an item, or decide not to set a Challenge level but allow the character to buy advantages in the spell with victories. These options can also be combined—it depends on the narrator.

##### Magic Level (first option)

The magic level (tier) is the threshold that determines whether the character knows the magic. If the character has a magical talent at level 1, they cannot perform magic from level 2 (maybe only if they had a book that increased their level, but otherwise not). This does not affect the Challenge level of solving the problem; it remains the same. The magic level threshold only indicates whether the character can use the spell to solve the problem or not.

>[!example]
>Fire Spell - level 2 = Challenge level 2 (or the character needs a talent in fire spells at level 2).

###### Primitive Magic – Level 0 -

**Rarity:** This magic is literally found everywhere and anyone can perform it, as it is as simple as striking a match or breathing.

**Who Knows It:** Everyone, even children, can do it. No one needs to learn it, or maybe just a little. Thus, a character does not need any talent to use it.

**Who Can Do It:** Everyone

**Where to Buy It:** It can be bought everywhere, commonly in stores, even at a newsstand. It can also be found freely on the street.

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires four times the amount of resources or four times the duration to achieve its effect (e.g., 4g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound for 4 days, 4 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can only perform very simple tasks that characters can do "almost with their eyes closed." For example, tying shoelaces, turning on a light, closing a door.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)
- Can use a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Cost of Magic#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of strength 1. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 1 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|point]].    

**For Example:**

- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). It is the same with magic at level 0.    
- Light: Shines like a candle.    
- Cooling: Cools hands to about 20 degrees.

###### Common – Level 1 -

**Rarity:** It is found in everyday life, at home, with neighbors, but not everyone possesses it - for example, homeless people may not have it.

**Who Knows It:** Adults can do it, but children cannot because they need to learn it. It is like collecting and drying herbs - one must learn which herbs are medicinal and which are poisonous.

**Who Can Do It:** Everyone

**Where to Buy It:** It can be bought in any ordinary store.

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires three times the amount of resources or three times the duration to achieve its effect (e.g., 3g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound for 3 days, 3 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can perform such common tasks that characters can do - for example, heating food like a microwave.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Cost of Magic#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of strength 2. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 2 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]].

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 1 can heal the wound in 2 days, plus cleanses the wound (like alcohol).    
- Light: Shines like a motorcycle light.    
- Cooling: Cools the entity to about 20 degrees.

###### Uncommon – Level 2 -

**Rarity:** Found in specialized places such as special stores (hardware stores), or in schools or libraries.

**Who Knows It:** Any student who studies this magic or someone who practices it as a hobby (e.g., an amateur electrician) can do it.

**Who Can Do It:** Only ordinary beings, not blessed ones.

**Where to Buy It:** It can be purchased in an unusual store (e.g., a hardware store).

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires double the amount of resources or double the duration to achieve its effect (e.g., 2g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound for 2 days, 2 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can perform tasks that characters usually do but require more effort, or a handyman (e.g., painting an apartment, moving heavy furniture, driving a car).

Unusual magic also includes items like magical crystals or other things we would consider miraculous in our real world and can be bought in those "magic stores" (e.g., healing stones, magical herbs, various amulets).

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Cost of Magic#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of total strength 4. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 4 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]]. 

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 2 can do it overnight, plus it can heal the wound if it is inflamed (if the wound is more inflamed, the magic needs to be used multiple times).    
- Light: Shines like a street lamp or the light on a large vehicle.    
- Cooling: Cools a room to 0 degrees.

###### Exceptional – Level 3 -

**Rarity:** Found only in specialized places like a doctor's office or an architect's studio.

**Who Knows It:** A good university student or a specialist who has graduated from university (e.g., a doctor, an architect) can perform it.

**Who Can Do It:** Only beings who have learned this magic. Not blessed ones.

**Where to Buy It:** It can only be purchased in specialized shops (e.g., a 3D printer store) or found in specialized locations (e.g., a medical university library).

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires the usual amount of resources or application (e.g., 1g of a resource - as the recipe requires, applying to a wound only once, 1 liter of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can perform tasks that specialists can do. This magic may break one or two natural laws of the given world.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Cost of Magic#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of total strength 6. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 6 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]].

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 3 can do it in a few minutes (for a large wound or severe inflammation about 1 hour).    
- Light: Shines like a stadium spotlight. The light spell can be specialized to shine only on the objects the wizard wants to illuminate.    
- Cooling: Cools all rooms in an apartment building to 0 degrees. Cools a room to -20 degrees.

###### Rare – Level 4 -

**Rarity:** Found in highly specialized places (e.g., research institutes that are unique in the district). Or in markets, royal treasuries, museums, ruins, or other inaccessible places. It exists in limited quantities and is known only by true experts.

**Who Knows It:** Only a professional who has been doing it for a long time (something like a kung-fu master) can perform it.

**Who Can Do It:** Only beings who have learned this magic. Not blessed ones.

**Where to Buy It:** In markets where rare items are sold, in museums (when the museum sells items to collectors), or from adventurers who discovered a secret temple.

**Consumption:** Compared to other levels, it requires half the amount of resources or application to achieve its effect (e.g., 0.5g of a resource instead of 1g, applying to a wound only once with half the amount of ointment, 0.5 liters of water).

**What It Can Do:** In the given world, it can do things that characters cannot. This magic can break several natural laws of the given world in a way that makes it impossible.

**Strength:** (if the narrator does not know how to classify the spell)

- Either can use [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Cost of Magic#What a Spell Can Do (second option)\|verbs]] of total strength 8. (See [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|RPG - Other Challenge Levels]])    
- Or can give 8 [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Wealth#Item Price\|points]].    

**For Example:**
- Healing: A tincture in our real world accelerates wound healing by 3 days (from 8 to 5). Magic at level 3 can do it in a few minutes (for a large wound or severe inflammation about 1 hour).    
- Light: Shines like a stadium spotlight. The light spell can be specialized to shine only on the objects the wizard wants to illuminate.    
- Cooling: Cools all rooms in an apartment building to 0 degrees. Cools a room to -20 degrees.

###### Legendary – Unreachable Level, or Level 8 -

**Rarity:** Found in legends, songs, folklore, or village rumors. This magic exists in material form only in one single -legendary- place.

**Who Knows It:** Only a legendary wizard who engages in extremely complex experiments can perform it.

**Where to Buy It:** There is only one legendary place where this magic can be bought.

**What It Can Do:** This magic breaks all the natural laws of the given world and performs things that are hard to imagine. For example, a staff of elements that can create and control any element.

###### Fairy Tale – Unreachable Level, or Level 16 -

**Rarity:** Exists only in fairy tales or in one completely hidden place.

**Who Knows It:** Only the one who discovered it, or a deity, can perform it.

**Where to Buy It:** Nowhere, or it can be bought from a deity for a high price.

**What It Can Do:** It can do things like in fairy tales. For example, a knife that opens doors to other worlds, or a ring that turns everything into sweets (like the legend of Midas).

###### Hidden – Unreachable Level, or Level 32 -

Only a deity can perform it, and they can grant this magic to any being (turning them into a messenger of the gods or a demigod). In the given world and all other worlds, it can perform things that are unimaginable.

###### Unreachable Level, or Level 64 -

This is something even gods cannot do. Only one single being across all universes can perform it. This magic can literally do anything on an infinite scale, including the destruction or creation of an entire world.

##### What a Spell Can Do (second option)

The Challenge level of a spell indicates the complexity of casting the spell. It can be determined by what the spell can accomplish. If a character is solving a problem in the story (e.g., wanting to jump over a fence) and the problem has a Challenge level (e.g., CL 3), the Challenge level of the spell does not add to the Challenge level of the problem. It is just a separate threshold the character must overcome to cast the spell (e.g., a jumping spell might have CL 2). If the character overcomes the Challenge level for casting the spell, the spell is cast, even if they do not pass the Challenge level for solving the problem. The same applies in reverse—if the character passes the CL for solving the problem but not the CL for casting the spell, they automatically fail the roll, even if they passed the CL for solving the problem.

The Challenge level for casting a spell can be determined fairly easily. In the section on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills STR\|skills]], you may notice that each skill has a list of verbs

>[!example]
>The skill "raw strength" includes verbs like (all listed in the respective section):
>
>Throw, Toss, Discard, Drop, Push, Move, Shift, Press

There is also a list of verbs for combat spells.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/z-rpg-variables/variables-mechanics/verbs-for-combat-spells/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




>[!note] .
>- HIT, (Strike, cut, or stab an enemy with a weapon, projectile, or hands), 
>- DEFEND (Hold, Lift, Protect, Endure, Follow, Stand Up, Defend, Endure, Stay) 
>- DESTROY (Explode, Break, Destroy, Crush) 
>- HURT (Suffer, Burn, Poison, Sicken (cause illness)) 
>- TACTIC (Set a trap, Follow, Track, Approach, Catch, Expect, Leave, Repeat, Open, Hold, Control, Manage) 
>
>The list may change, or other actions may be added. 
>As for magical elements, they also have their own verbs. However, we write about them in [[MAG - Elements\|another place]].


</div></div>


Each verb from the skill costs 1 Challenge level (the first verb is free). So if a spell pushes someone, it will have CL 0, but if it lifts + crushes, then the spell will have CL 1. For spells where it is clear that another verb must be included (e.g., for the verb "throw away," "lift" must also be part of the spell), the CL does not increase, as the effects of the verbs occur immediately, and the whole action happens in a second (e.g., the wizard immediately lifts the enemy and then immediately throws them away). The CL of the spell increases when each verb of the spell can be performed separately (e.g., lift - keep the enemy lifted for a few seconds and then crush).

The power of the spell also increases its complexity. Each verb can perform a "human-like strength" (e.g., the spell "throw away" can throw an object as heavy and as far as a regular human can). To make the spell stronger, it must have a higher Challenge level.

One way to determine the complexity is to refer to the section [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/01 CHALLENGE LEVEL/RPG - Other Challenge Levels\|Other Challenge Levels]].

>[!example]
>A spell that can throw someone will have:
> - CL 1 for the verb "throw away" (since it is the first verb, it is free)
> - plus 4 CL if the object is heavy, around 80 kg (approximately the weight of a baby elephant)
> - (So the spell will have a total of CL 4)

##### By Points of Wealth (third option)

The narrator can determine the Challenge level based on what the spell should do or add (e.g., add [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] to another character). They can use the rule about [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]. In this case, all spell attributes are listed and converted to a cost according to the list below.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/loregent/1-roleplay/04-points/rpg-points-of-wealth/#cena-predmetu" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">




### [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]]

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] refer to the amount of money a character carries. The number is determined by the narrator, and unless stated otherwise, every character receives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/amount of points/6 points\|6]]0 wealth points at the beginning of the game. These points can be increased when the character invests in the attribute [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] and can further be increased by selling, stealing, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward\|completing tasks]].

#### How much money should the character receive?

At the beginning of the story, each character receives a certain amount of money. Below is a list of wealth levels. The narrator determines the character's wealth level according to this list.

- Homeless: (0 - 10)
- Low-income: (11 - 20)
- Average income: (21 - 40)
- Good income: (41 - 80)
- Upper class: (81 - 160)
- High class: (161 - 320)
- Wealthier: (321 - 640)
- Rich: (641 - 1,280)
- Very rich: (1,281 - 2,560)
- Extra rich: (2,561 - 5,120)

If the narrator can't decide how much money a character should receive, they can roll dice, for example, when characters meet a wandering merchant. The number rolled on the dice is multiplied by 10 to determine how much money the other character (such as the wandering merchant) has. If it’s a very wealthy character, the narrator can roll multiple dice.

#### Consumption of wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] (p.w.) in our system are considered as money, such as euros, coins, credits. This is because they are spent in the same way as those mentioned euros, coins, credits. So if something costs, for example, 10 p.w. and the character has 30 p.w. in their pockets, after purchasing the item, the character will have only 20 p.w. left.

###### Item Price

The price of an item is determined by its physical and magical properties (or its enchantments):

- **Adds dice to a roll ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]) = attribute x 1**    
    - When an item adds dice to a skill roll that results in solving a problem. This roll must not result in harming another character. If used in [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|combat]], the results can only be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|pacifistic victory options]].        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] dice to a character.        
    - (e.g., bandage, glasses, invisibility cloak)        
- **Related to combat (i.e., adds attack or armor) = attribute x 2**    
    - When an item adds dice to an attack or increases the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|max damage level]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Armor\|Armor]] to a character.        
    - When the duration of a useful effect is increased, such as a healing aura or a useful elemental. Number of turns +1.        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that increases damage level.        
- **Adds an advantage = attribute x 3**    
    - When an item adds a special feature that cannot be categorized among other items. For example, breathing underwater, fast reloading, etc.        
    - Change in the level of difficulty by 1.        
- **Increases Attributes and other points = attribute x 4**    
    - When an item adds basic attributes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]].        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Inventory\|Points of Inventory]] or reduces weight.        
    - When an item adds [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Health\|Points of Health]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]].        
    - When an item contains a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/enabling disabling characteristics/RPG - Perk#Powerful Traits for Items\|strong trait]] without disadvantage (or with a minor advantage).        
    - The price also considers repairing or supplementing an attribute that gives attributes or points.

- If these properties give the item advantages (e.g., attack +1), the price increases.  
- If these properties give the item a disadvantage (e.g., weapon reloads in 3 turns), the price decreases.

##### For Example

> [!example]
>- Leather armor, which adds 3 points of [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Armor\|armor]] -> price 6
>- Long axe, which increases max damage by 2 -> price 4
>-  Bandage, which adds 3 dice to [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Health#Liečenie zranenia\|natural regeneration]] -> price 3
>- Healing potion, which immediately adds 2 health points -> price 8

##### Quality and Price

If the narrator wants, they can adjust the final price according to the quality or rarity. If the item is rare or of higher quality, the price increases. And if the item is damaged, or is something abundant (like sand in the desert), the price decreases.

- Trash - 16 p.w.
- Horrible / Damaged - 8 p.w.
- Bad / Very abundant item - 4 p.w.
- Worse / Abundant item - 2 p.w.
- Normal + 0 p.w. (base for all items)
- Better / Unusual + 2 p.w.
- Quality / Exceptional + 4 p.w.
- Good / Rare + 8 p.w.
- Very rare + 16 p.w.

##### Merchant Markup

The final price can also be increased by the merchant's markup. To determine it, one, two, or three dice are used (depending on how much the merchant wants to earn). The narrator rolls the dice and the value rolled:

- is added up and added to the final price of the item (when the character buys from the merchant),
- or subtracted from the final price (when the character sells something to the merchant).

#### Price in the Story

When a character wants to buy a room in a hotel, sell a car, or buy a beer—how much will they pay? The narrator can decide how to proceed.

##### First Option

The first option is that the price of an item or service is determined by the number of points (dice, or attributes) a character receives. For example, when a character rents a room in a hotel, they do so to rest and thus restore their [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Speed\|Points of Speed]]. The price will reflect the number of points the character restores. If it is an item that brings some benefit to the character (for example, a nice shirt adds dice to the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/SOC/Persuasion\|Persuasion]] skill), the number of points (or dice) the item brings to the character determines the final price.

##### Second Option

The second option is that the price is determined according to the scale:

- Cheap: 1 - 5
- Common: 5 - 9
- Pricier: 10 - 14
- Expensive: 15 - 19
- and so on

##### Third Option

The third option is that the narrator looks up the price of an item in our real world, divides it by 30, and rounds up. The minimum price of an item is always 1 p.w.

>[!example]
>A new car costs 22,000 €, so the price should be around 733 p.w.

Of course, the same applies as above. If an item or service is rare (or common) in the given world, the narrator can adjust the price of the service (see section [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Cost of Magic#Quality and Price\|Quality and Price]]).

#### Earning points of Wealth

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Points/Points of Wealth\|Points of Wealth]] increase when a character sells something, completes [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Body za splnenie príbehovej úlohy\|a task]], receives a reward for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Reward#Prvá možnosť Body podľa úrovne nepriateľov\|defeating an enemy]], or performs a job. They receive their money directly from other characters. The money is added just like during consumption. So if a character has 20 p.w. and sells an item for 30, they will have 50 p.w.

#### Negotiating Prices with a Merchant

The price of an item in a shop can be lowered or increased in favor of the character. To do this, any [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used, rolled as an [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/active conflict\|active conflict]] against any of the merchant's [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Skills SOC\|skills]] from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute. The price with the merchant can also be changed through simple conversation, or the character can solve the merchant's problem.

If a character decides they want to negotiate the price with the merchant, they choose the skill they will use (any from the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]] attribute can be used) and state how much they want to adjust the price in their favor (e.g., lower the price when buying, or increase the price when selling). For each point the character changes their price, the merchant gets that many wins added to their roll. This number is divided by 2.

> [!example] 
> For example, a character wants to change the price (in their favor) by 
> 
> 1 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 2 = the merchant gets 1 win in their roll
> 3 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 4 = the merchant gets 2 wins in their roll
> 5 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 6 = the merchant gets 3 wins in their roll
> 
> and so on

> [!example]
> - A character wants to buy an axe that costs 6.
> - The character wants to lower the price by 4 points.
> - The merchant gets 2 wins in their roll.

- When the price negotiation is won by the character, the price is adjusted by the amount they wanted.
- When the price negotiation is won by the merchant, the price is adjusted unfavorably for the character by the number of additional wins the merchant rolled. These wins are then multiplied by 5.

> [!example] (...continuing from the previous example)
> - The character rolled 4 wins
> - The merchant rolled 3 wins + 2 that they received
> - The merchant, therefore, rolled 1 more win than the character
> <br>
> - If the character wanted to buy the item, its price increases by 5 points
> - If the character wanted to sell the item, its price decreases by 5 points

Price negotiation can only be rolled once.

##### By Number of Victories (fourth option)

In this case, the cost of the spell is approached as if the character wants to create or upgrade an item—see [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/04 POINTS/RPG - Points of Items\|Points of Items]]. The victories from the roll are considered as money, which the character uses to buy the result for their spell. This can be according to the price listed above, or as determined by the narrator.

>[!example]  
> For example, a summoning spell
> - The number of victories from the magical roll represents the number of points that the player can invest in the stats of an elemental, golem, etc.
> 	- 1 victory point for 1 attribute point of the golem
> 		- HP (1 HP is free)
> 		- Attack (1 attack is free)
> 	- How many rounds it will exist (1 round is free)
> 		- 2 victory points for 1 attribute point of the golem
> 		- Armor (golem has no armor for free)
> - The summoned golem obeys only the player who summoned it. It does what it is told (it has some basic intelligence but no free will or soul)
