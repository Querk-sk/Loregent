### Basics of Magic

This chapter contains basic information about magic, which you can use to create your own magical system. If you are looking for a magical system directly from our universe, you will find it in another book [[MAG - Full Book\|MAG - Full Book]].

>[!warning] 
>The word '[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Magic\|Magic]]' or the word 'spell' in our RPG system is used as:
>- A spell (fireball)
>- Super abilities (laser eyes) 
>- Sci-fi technologies (hologram, teleport) 
>- Skills of skilled craftsmen (a cook and his spell 'my special pizza') 
>- Traits according to the type of character (a turtle that can spit out a stream of water) 
>- and other similar things.

A character can use magic for combat, defense, or to perform any other activity that comes from the given spell (e.g., a fireball to light a campfire).

Magic and spells work the same way as: [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Skill\|skills]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat\|Combat]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|Weapons]]. So if you have read these chapters, you already know almost everything about magic.

#### Who Can Use Spells?

Unless otherwise specified, any character can use magic. However, the narrator can modify this by setting specific restrictions in their magical system.

>[!example] 
> - Magic can only be used by a character with a certain attribute level (e.g., INT 2 and above),
> - or requires a special talent (e.g., fire school 1),
> - or requires a specialization (e.g., ranged fire spells 2),
> - or must have an item to cast spells (e.g., spell crystal),
> -  or an essence (e.g., fire essence),
> - or a weapon with a spell (e.g., fire axe).

If a character without a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/03 CHARACTER/attributes skills talent/RPG - Specialization\|specialization]] (for combat magic) uses magic, they roll with a major [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/disadvantage\|disadvantage]]. If the character has a talent but no specialization in combat spells from that school, they roll normally (no major disadvantage), but they do not get any dice from the talent.

>[!example]
>The talent "fire school." For the offensive spell fireball, the character gets no dice but rolls normally. (Without the talent, they would have to roll with a major disadvantage.)

##### Talent and Knowledge of Magic

One way the narrator can restrict the use of magic is by tying magical knowledge to a character's talent. This means that a character will only know spells or magical items that have the same level as the number of points the character has invested in their magical talent. So the number of points in the talent indicates the maximum level of magic the character can use (that they remember). If a character wants to use a higher-level spell, they must find it in a book, but cannot use it from memory.

>[!example]
> - 1 point in talent = Level 1
> - 2 points in talent = Level 2
> - 3 points in talent = Level 3
> - 4 points in talent = Level 4

If the narrator's magic system does not use levels, the number of points in the talent indicates the maximum attack strength (or spell effectiveness) the character can use.

>[!example]
> - 1 point in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 2
> - 2 points in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 4
> - 3 points in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 6
> - 4 points in talent = maximum number of dice (or other points) 8
> - 5 points similarly = the number of points in the talent is multiplied by 2.

If a spell does not require talent, or the character has a minus in talent, the maximum number of dice (or other points) for the spell becomes 1 or Level 0.

#### Talent and Knowledge of Magic

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] is used for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spells, specialization for offensive spells and passive spells (which can be passively [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] or passively offensive). Each point in talent adds a die to the roll when the character is solving a problem with a spell (similarly to skills).

[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] adds dice to the magical combat roll, increases the maximum damage of the spell, and reduces the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Challenge Level\|CL]] for passive spells.

#### Magic Effects

Unless otherwise specified, magic is neutral. Offensive spells can harm allies, and healing spells can heal enemies. This is especially true when they are within the spell's effect range or when the character fails their dice roll.
