### Spellcasting Failure

If a character fails the Challenge level, the narrator can decide that instead of the character casting "nothing," the spell will be weaker, something unintended happens, or the spell benefits the enemy.

If a character fails the magic roll so drastically that they roll half as many victories as needed, or roll no victories at all, a catastrophe occurs.

#### Catastrophes During Spellcasting (according to Cogent Roleplay)

A catastrophe occurs when the luck die rolls a 1.

- **Wizard Spells**    
    - **Pyromancy** - An explosion occurs, the wizard is burned - 3rd degree burns.        
    - **Hydromancy** - An explosion occurs, filling the entire room with water. The high pressure causes the wizard to suffer fractures.        
    - **Aeromancy** - The wizard creates a maximum scale tornado that cannot be stopped.        
    - **Terramancy** - The wizard creates a massive chasm or the room is swallowed by the earth.       
- **Wizard Spells - Summoning Helper - Elemental**    
    - The elemental will attack the wizard. It will not obey. It will last for 8 rounds and has 10 combat dice and 8 HP.        
- **Mage Spells**    
    - **Divination** - The mage receives a curse. Changes their (or someone else's) future to the worst possible version.        
    - **Levitation** - The mage or object flies into the air like a rocket or is cut in half (one part flies up, the other is pulled down by gravity).        
    - **Telepathy** - The mage reveals everything about themselves to the other person. Or the other person will control the mage's thoughts for 24 hours.        
    - **Teleport** - Death of the mage or destruction of the item.        
    - **Environmental Manipulation** - Catastrophic scenario. Want to increase the temperature? +3000°C. Want to cool the surroundings a bit? -2000°C.        
- **Witchcraft**    
    - **Modification** (changing the physical property of a substance) - The change will be critically large. Size change? The object will be gigantic or disappear (become microscopic). Weight change? A black hole forms.        
    - **Transformation of Objects** (changing the chemical property of a substance, or changing a poisonous potion to a healing one) - The substance turns into a corrosive acid (like the acid in the Alien movie), an explosive, or a toxic gas.        
    - **Transformation** (turning into a werewolf) - The change is permanent. Body, mind, and soul are altered.        
    - **Dominance** (controlling people remotely) - The witch is possessed by a demon or the person they are trying to control takes over their body.        
    - **Sympathy** - The two things merge together or randomly swap properties, or both are destroyed.        
- **Druidism**    
    - **Naturmancy** (controlling an animal or plant) - The controlled entity will not obey the druid and will attack.        
    - **Reflection** (reflecting a spell or transferring a property, e.g., aging from a person to a young tree, making the person younger) - The property the druid wants to get rid of becomes permanent and worsens by 2x.        
    - **Communication** (druid can communicate with animals) - The animal attacks the druid.     
- **Necromancy**    
    - **Raising the Dead** - The wizard swaps consciousness (soul) with the body they wanted to revive.        
- **Heavenly Miracles**    
    - **Restoration** (healing, cleansing) - The opposite of healing happens - greater damage or a worse illness.        
    - **Blessing** (adding attributes) - Attributes are reduced to -2.        
    - **Creation** (creating food, weapons) - The created item is rotten and diseased. The rot and poison infect with a strange magical disease that consumes them alive.        
    - **Discovery** (same as divination and telepathy for mages) - Choose a catastrophe from mages.        
    - **Mobility** (walking on water or air) - The blessed wizard is subjected to 100 G, crushing all their bones or experiencing reverse G, causing them to be flung from the planet.        
- **Other Spells** - The exact opposite of the spell occurs, or an explosion happens.    
- **Other Spells - Alternate Option** - The character loses the ability to cast the spell.

#### Catastrophes During Spellcasting (in our universe)

A catastrophe occurs whenever the character fails their dice roll. So, the luck die is not rolled.
- The spell helps the enemy.    
- Or the spell affects the character who cast it. (For example, flames burst out at the character and they start burning).    
- Or the character turns into a [[LOREGENT/Assets/Fleeting Notes/Genasi - Kúzelnárovia\|Genasi]].
