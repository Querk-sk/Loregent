### Spells

A spell is created when magical talent or magical specialization combines with a skill. Spells can be [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]], and they can be cast independently (as active spells) or function automatically (as passive spells) when a condition is met.

#### Active and Passive Spells

**Active spells** are those that the character decides to cast. This can be when a situation arises in the story that the character wants to resolve using a spell (similarly to skills), or during combat when the character attacks someone. Active attack spells can have their unique levels of victory but also have a cost that must be paid (more on this topic is written in the section about [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Cost of Magic\|the cost of magic]]).

**Passive spells** function automatically, but only during certain rolls. For example, only during combat, or when the character is swimming, and so on. Passive spells activate when certain numbers are rolled on the dice. For example, if the number 1 is rolled during combat, the character gets +1 frost armor for each number 1 rolled.

#### How are spells cast?

Each spell is cast as follows:

- 3 dice as the base    
- plus dice from basic Attributes ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/STR\|STR]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/INT\|INT]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/SOC\|SOC]])    
- plus dice from magical talent when casting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spells    
- plus dice from magical specialization when casting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]] spells    
- plus dice from skill    
- plus/minus dice for bonuses from items (if the character has any)    
- plus/minus dice for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances\|circumstances]] (if they are present)

#### How are spells created?

The storyteller can create spells as needed and as it fits into their story. Generally, useful spells are created by combining a magical [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|Talent]] with a skill. Offensive spells are created by combining a magical [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|Specialization]] with a skill. This means that each spell is connected to a skill. All the spells of a character are then written into the character sheet.

>[!example]
>Ice Shield - specialization Ice Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Endurance\|Endurance]]
>Fire Wall - specialization Fire Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Working with hands\|Working with hands]]
>Wind Arrows - specialization Wind Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]]
>Jump - specialization Robo Mage + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] (the character has robotic legs)

Which spell can be connected with which skill? Each skill has a list of verbs associated with it (for example, the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]] has verbs like: understand, guess, analyze, solve a puzzle). So you just need to look at the list of verbs for each skill and choose the one that fits.

If you can't choose because your verb (the action the spell is supposed to perform) isn't there, you can create a new skill. This new skill is written into the list of talents (or wherever there is space in the character sheet) and assigned a main attribute. This skill can also be used in the game if the storyteller allows, but its main purpose is to create a spell (for example, teleport, which is not a great example because teleport is created with the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Sprint\|Sprint]], because sprint includes a jump).

As for the verbs, each element also has its own list of verbs.

##### Purely Combat Spells

For combat spells, the rule remains that they must be linked to a skill. Additionally, they must be connected to a combat skill from which they can choose a verb (allowed action) they need. However, this "combat skill" does not add any dice and does not require the character to use points to purchase this "combat skill." It mainly serves as a reminder of what the spell actually does.

>[!example]
>Spell "Fireball"
> - specialization Fire School
> - plus skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]]
> - plus combat skill (explode, burn – see verbs for combat spells below)

##### Limitations

However, there are a few limitations when creating spells. For instance, one skill can only be associated with one talent or specialization. Unless, of course, it is another function of the same spell, such as creating an ice wall and creating an ice bridge – in this case, multiple spells can be associated with one skill. But otherwise, it is not possible.

If the storyteller (or character) needs to create spells in their character sheet that require the same skill, then they must invest 1 skill point (the point used to invest in skills, talents, and specializations when creating a character) into that spell. For such a spell, the character also gets +1 die for that 1 point.

A spell also cannot be associated with multiple skills. Only one. If a spell needs to have multiple skills, then multiple spells must be created, which are cast sequentially like a "chain." In this case, all spells (before the main one) are cast as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/Self-assistance roll\|Self-assistance roll]].

##### Enhancing a Spell

Each spell can be enhanced by investing a point into that spell during character creation, as well as by using magical items, essence, or training.

- An item enhances a spell when the character holds or wears the item. If the item is removed from the character's body or sold, the item no longer enhances the spell. (e.g., glasses: spell "seeing through walls" +2 dice)    
- Essence enhances a spell when the character uses it during casting. However, the essence burns out after the spell is cast.    
- A spell can be permanently enhanced through training or by the character investing points into it. Such a spell is written into the character sheet along with the number of points. And every time the character casts that spell, the dice from the enhancement points are added.
 
#### Are All Spells Weapons?

We classify spells as [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] and [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]]. However, all spells, regardless of classification, must have some weapon attributes based on what type of weapon they resemble.

- Whether they resemble a melee weapon (like a sword) or a ranged/thrown weapon.    
- Whether they are similar to a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Blunt weapons\|Blunt]] weapon, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Sharp weapons\|Sharp]] weapon, [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Piercing weapons\|Piercing]] weapon, or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Explosive weapons\|Explosive]] weapon (for explosive weapons, the area of effect must be determined).    
- The size of this weapon and its area of effect, whether it is a touch weapon (like hand guards), a small weapon, a medium weapon, or a large weapon.    
- Whether this weapon uses ammunition and if any special ammunition can be used. (Everything else about classification is written in the [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons\|weapons chapter]].)

Another attribute that weapons have is attack. Therefore, combat spells also have attacks, which determine the maximum damage a character can deal to their enemy during combat. All spells have an attack level of 1 (meaning each combat spell causes at least 1 injury). This level of damage that a spell can cause can be increased by specialization in a particular school of spells, as well as by items and investment in spells.

#### Victory Levels of Spells

Offensive spells can have their own [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|victory levels]] written next to them. For example, a fireball at Victory Level 1 causes burns, but at Victory Level 3, it sets the enemy on fire. Similarly, a spell at a higher victory level can inflict a status on the enemy (such as making them catch fire). In this case, the victory level also becomes the Level of Difficulty, which the enemy must overcome to rid themselves of the status. Healing the status during combat is considered a quick action.
