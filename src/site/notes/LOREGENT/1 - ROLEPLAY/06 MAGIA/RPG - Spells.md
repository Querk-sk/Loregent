### Spells

In our RPG system, spells function similarly to items, weapons, actions, or a list of combat maneuvers. However, they enable actions that may be unimaginable for many characters—such as conjuring fire from nothing. Because of this, a character must possess magical talent or specialization. These traits are also crucial in spell creation, as a spell (in our RPG system) is formed by combining magical talent with a specific skill.

#### Spell Classification

**[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|Useful]] spells** are those whose primary purpose is not to harm an enemy. These typically include healing spells (e.g., "Aura of Healing"), spells that create helpful objects or structures (e.g., "Ice Bridge"), or spells that solve specific problems (e.g., "Unlocking Spell"). Utility spells are formed by combining them with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Talent\|talent]].

**[[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|Damaging]] spells** are those designed primarily to damage an enemy or destroy an object or structure (e.g., "Fire Whirl"). Offensive spells are created by combining them with [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Mechanics/Specialization\|specialization]].

**Active spells** are those a character actively performs in response to a situation they wish to resolve using magic—much like skills—or during combat when attacking someone. Offensive active spells may have unique victory levels but also come with a price that must be paid (more details are covered in the section on [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/06 MAGIA/RPG - Cost of Magic\|the cost of magic]]).

**Passive spells** function automatically but only under certain rolls, such as during combat or while swimming. Passive spells activate when specific dice numbers appear. For example, if a character rolls a "1" during battle, they may gain +1 Frost Armor for each "1" rolled.

#### How are spells cast?

Each spell is rolled using:

- 3 base dice    
- plus dice from magical talent when casting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]] spells    
- plus dice from magical specialization when casting [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]] spells    
- plus dice from relevant skills    
- plus dice from primary Attributes that govern the specific skill (e.g., [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Perception\|Perception]] + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Attributes/REF\|REF]])   
- plus dice from items the character uses    
- plus/minus dice for [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Combat circumstances\|circumstances]] (if applicable)
#### How are spells created?

The narrator can craft spells as needed to fit the narrative. These spells should be accessible to any character with appropriate education or background. Generally, each spell is linked to a skill—utility spells connect with talent, while offensive spells link to specialization.

>[!example] For example: 
>Ice Shield – Specialization: Cryomancer + [[Resilience\|Resilience]] 
>Fire Wall – Talent: Pyromancer + [[Handwork\|Handwork]] 
>Wind Arrows – Specialization: Aeromancer + [[Agility\|Agility]] 
>Leap – Talent: Robomancer + [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/STR/Raw Strength\|Raw Strength]] (character has robotic legs)

But how do these spells get assigned? Which skill do they connect to? Each skill has a list of associated verbs (e.g., the skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/INT/Thinking\|Thinking]] includes verbs like: understand, sense, analyze, solve puzzles). To create a spell, simply review the verb list for a skill and choose one that fits.

If no suitable verb is available—perhaps because it's too unique—you can create a new skill. This new skill is added to the talent list (or the skills section, wherever appropriate in the character table) and assigned a primary attribute. It can be used in gameplay if the storyteller allows it, but its core purpose is to enable spell creation.

What about elements like fire, water, earth, and air? [[MAG - Elements\|Magical elements]] (or other essences) are also considered skills and must have their own verb lists.

#### Purely Combat Spells

Combat spells also need to be linked to one or more combat-related verbs. However, this connection does not add any extra dice—it only determines the final cost of the spell and helps ensure clarity on what the spell actually does.

>[!example] For example: 
>Spell "Fireball" 
> - Specialization: Fire School 
> - plus skill [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/Variables Skills Talent etc/REF/Skillfulness\|Skillfulness]] 
> - plus combat-specific verbs = explode, burn

>[!note] Categories of combat verbs
>- HIT, (Strike, cut, or stab an enemy with a weapon, projectile, or hands), 
>- DEFEND (Hold, Lift, Protect, Endure, Follow, Stand Up, Defend, Endure, Stay) 
>- DESTROY (Explode, Break, Destroy, Crush) 
>- HURT (Suffer, Burn, Poison, Sicken (cause illness)) 
>- TACTIC (Set a trap, Follow, Track, Approach, Catch, Expect, Leave, Repeat, Open, Hold, Control, Manage) 

Verbs are arranged into categories for clarity. When creating a spell, a single verb (e.g., "hold on") is selected rather than an entire category (e.g., the "Defend Yourself" category). The list of verbs may change or have additional ones added.

#### Spell Enhancement

Each spell can be upgraded by investing a point into it when creating a character, or later through magical items, essences, or training.

- **Items** enhance a spell as long as the character is holding or wearing them. If they remove or sell the item, it no longer boosts the spell (e.g., glasses: "See Through Walls" spell +2 dice).    
- **Essences** enhance a spell when used during casting, but they burn out after the spell is completed.    
- **Training** permanently upgrades a spell by improving the talent or specialization associated with it.

#### Are All Spells Weapons?

Regardless of their classification ([[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/damaging\|damaging]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables Dices/useful\|useful]]), all spells must share certain [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Weapon Attributes\|weapon attributes]] based on their resemblance to specific weapons. These attributes include:

- Whether the spell resembles a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Melee Weapons\|melee weapon]] (like a sword) or a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Weapons#Ranged and Thrown Weapons\|ranged/thrown weapon]].    
- Whether its effect is similar to a [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Blunt weapons\|Blunt weapons]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Sharp weapons\|Sharp weapons]], [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Piercing weapons\|Piercing weapons]], or [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/z RPG variables/variables weapons/Explosive weapons\|Explosive weapons]] (explosive spells require defining their area of effect).    
- The size and range of the spell—whether it acts as a touch-based weapon (like hand guards), a small weapon, a medium weapon, or a large weapon.    
- Whether the spell uses ammunition and if special ammunition can be applied.    

Another key attribute is maximum damage, which determines the highest injury a character can inflict on an enemy in combat. Every spell has a base attack level of 1, meaning each combat spell causes at least 1 damage. This damage level can be increased through specialization in the relevant school of magic or further enhanced by items.

#### Spell Victory Levels

Offensive spells may include their own unique [[LOREGENT/1 - ROLEPLAY/05 COMBAT/RPG - Victory levels\|victory levels]]. At higher victory levels, a spell can inflict a status effect on an enemy—such as setting them on fire. The victory level then becomes a difficulty level that the enemy must overcome to remove the status. Curing a status effect during combat is considered a quick action.

>[!example] For example: 
>Spell: Fireball 
>- At victory level 1, it causes burns. 
>- At victory level 3, it ignites the enemy.
