## EXPENSIVE INVESTMENTS - INDUSTRY
verzia 4 _ 19.10.2024

### About a game

Each player becomes the owner of a well-functioning company, aiming to expand their empire. The winner is the player who has the most money and companies.

The board game “Expensive Investments - Industry” is intended for adults and children aged 10 and above. The recommended number of players is 2 to 5. However, the game can also be played by one player or more. The number of players is essentially unlimited, well - it is limited only by the number of game pieces and amount of money in the game (meaning the amount of paper bills).

>[!note]
>In our game, in addition to the official rules, there may also be alternative rules in some places. You can choose to use them, or not. It depends on whether you want to spice up the game. The selection of rules must take place at the beginning of the game.

#### The game contains

* Game board 
* Game manual 
* 6 playing tokens (which serve as game pieces) 
* 2 dice 
* 42 Profit cards 
* 42 Loss cards 
* 22 Shortcut cards 
* 29 Global Economy cards 
* 7 Tax Office cards 
* 15 Bank cards 
* 71 business cards 
* 75 small tokens for marking investments 
* 25 large tokens for marking monopolies 
* 20 small tokens for marking the number of rounds on expiring cards 
* And paper money in the following quantities: 500,000 (20 pieces), 100,000 (35 pieces), 50,000 (35 pieces), 20,000 (45 pieces), 10,000 (45 pieces), 5,000 (35 pieces).

#### Game preparation

The players lay out the game plan. The PROFIT, LOSS, SHORTCUT, and GLOBAL ECONOMY cards are shuffled and placed in their designated spots. While the remaining cards are placed beside the game board, in the area where the bank is located.

The number of players is counted, and then receive the money according to the amount of players (see section - Money for Players). Each player chooses one playing token. One person is selected to act as the banker during the game.

### Start of the game

The game can start in two ways: either all players begin with the full amount of money at the Start tile, or players draw one business and start the game there (explained below in “Business lottery”).

#### Start tile

The Start tile is considered to be the third tile of the Bank group, located in the top left corner of the game board. It is also specially marked.

#### Business lottery

At the beginning of the game, each player draws one random business, which becomes the player’s property. Each player then places their game token on the business they drew. This is the position from which they will start the game. This space is only considered a starting position at the beginning of the game. Each player’s turn ends, when they land on (or pass) the Bank tiles. Regardless of where they started or how quickly they moved across the game board.

During the game, a player can sell their drawn business, lose it, or can be buyed by another player in a force trade. The business drawn in the lottery is not protected and is considered a normally purchased business.

##### How to draw Businesses

The business lottery works like this. Player takes 2D6 and designates which die will be first and which will be second. They then roll one die and then the second. The value of the first die is multiplied by 10, and the value of the second die is added to it. The resulting number is the identification number of the business, player receives.

>[!example] For example : 
> The player designates which die will be first and which will be second - and then rolls the dice. The first die shows 2, and the second die shows 4. The value of the first die is multiplied by 10, resulting in 20. And the second die, which is 4, is added. So the final identification number is 24. The player receives the business.

The identification number is found in the business table, which serves as a reference for the lottery. Player finds the number and selects the business accordingly. If they draw a business already owned by another player, they roll again. This card also lists bonuses or conditions, which the player must meet to receive his business (e.g. pay half the price of the business).

##### Business lottery - ALTERNATIVE RULE

1. At the beginning of the game, instead of receiving one business, the player will receive an entire series of the business. The condition for acquiring one business - applies once - for the entire series. If another player draws a business already owned by someone else, they roll again. 
2. At the beginning of the game, the player receives the business they drew. However, this business will be at the level of a monopoly. It does not matter if the player does not have the entire series of businesses of one color.

#### Amount of Money for Players

At the start of the game, the banker gives each player money depending on the number of players. The remaining money stays with the bank

1 player gets 6 million
2 players get 3 million each
3 players get 2 million each
4 players get 1 million 500 thousand each
5 players get 1 million 200 thousand each
6 or more players get 1 million each

After each lap around the board, i.e. landing on or passing the Bank tile, players receive a subsidy of 300k from the bank. This amount is the same for any number of players.

The subsidy payout action takes precedence over mortgage payments, which take precedence over any other actions (so, the player first receives the subsidy, then pays the mortgage, and if they land on business someone else owns, then they pay fees. After all that, they can trade businesses or buy investments or monopolies, if they want).

### Playing the game

The game works similarly to Monopoly, Investor, or Dostigy a Sázky. So if you know how to play these games, you know how to play Expensive Investments. However, our game has some improvements.

#### Direction of the Game

The game pieces always move towards the Bank tile in a clockwise direction. This applies to dice rolls as well as to cards that send the player somewhere. Every time a player passes the Bank space(i.e. the start), they receive a subsidy.

The rule about the direction of the game does not apply to Shortcut cards, which can send the player back.

##### Order of players

At the beginning, players agree on their turn order. If they cannot agree, they roll a die. The player with the highest number goes first. If multiple players roll the same number, they roll again until the order is clearly determined.

The game starts with the first player rolling the dice. The following players then take their turns in the agreed order until the game ends.

#### Rolling the Dice

Two dice are used, and their values are always added together. The player moves their game piece according to the total value rolled.

When a player rolls the same value on both dice, they can choose to:

* EITHER do nothing and accept the rolled value.
* OR roll again and add the second roll to the first. 
    * (If the player rolls the same value again, they don’t roll again—the value is simply added to the first roll.)
* OR choose any space to move to. 
    * (They can pick any space within the range of 1 to the value rolled on ONE die.)

>[!example] For example:
> A player rolls a five on both dice (totaling ten). They can choose to either: Move forward ten spaces, Roll again and add the second roll to the first, Or choose a space from one to five to move to.

This rule applies to any value rolled on the dice (even two ones).

#### Single game piece - ALTERNATIVE RULE

For more fun, the game Expensive Investments can be played with just one game piece. This means the entire group of players is represented by a single piece on the board. In this case, all rules remain unchanged except for the following :

* Business lottery = At the beginning, businesses are not drawn; the game starts on the Start tile. 
* Switching Players = Each turn, a different player rolls the dice. This (rolling) player also decides the movement of the game piece (i.e., the entire group). 
* Buying Businesses = Every business goes to auction. The starting price (from the business card) is the auction's opening bid. All players bid according to the auction rule. The business goes to the player with the highest bid, becoming its sole owner. 
* Paying Fees = When the group lands on a business owned by another player, the entire group pays the fee to that player, except for the player who owns the business. 
* Investments, Monopolies = This rule remains unchanged. 
* Loss, Profit, Start, Tax Office, Global Economy, etc. = The drawn card or tile command applies to all players equally. If the command cannot be executed, it is ignored, or another card is drawn.

### Players action

All player actions have their sequence and must not be skipped. Below is the entire list of actions ordered sequentially.

1. The player rolls the dice and moves forward the number of spaces indicated by the dice roll.
    * In this step, the player follows the rules for rolling the dice (see above).
    * In this step, the player can also use a Shortcut card, but only after rolling the dice. However, using a Shortcut card is still considered only one action (well - this “rolling dice” action).
2. When a player lands on a tile, they must resolve the situation that the tile presents.
    * Bank
        * If a player passes all the Bank tiles, and does not land on any specific Bank tile in this group, they receive a subsidy. 
        * When a player lands on a specific Bank tile, they receive a subsidy, plus some extra money, as indicated (written) on the tile they landed on.
            * The player receives their subsidy immediately.
        * If the player has a loan, they must pay all the fees associated with the loan. 
            * The player must pay all fees to the Bank immediately.
            * This applies even if the player skips all Bank spaces and lands on another space, such as a business. Payment to the Bank takes priority over all other actions.
    * Businesses
        * If a player lands on a business tile that no one owns, they can buy it.
        * If a player lands on a business tile owned by another player, they must pay fees to that player. (Each player keeps track of their own fees.)
        * If a player lands on a business tile they own, and has all businesses of that color, they can invest in their business.
    * Other tile
        * If a player lands on a different type of tile, they follow its specific rules.
    * Lack of Money?
        * If a player doesn't have enough money to resolve their situation, they can either request a loan from the Bank at this step, or they can sell their business to the Bank (at this step, only to the Bank).
3. When a player has resolved all situations presented by the game tile, they are free to trade.
    * They can sell their businesses to the Bank, or they can offer their businesses to another player. They can also request a loan from the Bank at this step.
4. A player can buy a Bank card (more about this card can be found in the section Game End).
5. When a player completes all their actions, the next player takes their turn.
6. When all players have taken their turns and the Global Economy card is still active, one token is removed from it. The round is (for the Global Economy card) based on the player who drew the card. This player is the only one who removes tokens from the card, and they do so at the very end of all the actions they perform. When there are no more tokens on the card, it is returned to the pile and it is no longer affecting the game.

#### Detailed rules for player actions

##### Buying a Business

When a player lands on a business tile that is not owned by any other player, they can buy it. The player pays the amount listed on the business card as the price of the business, and the bank issues them a deed of ownership. If the player does not want to buy the business, the next player takes their turn. In this case, the business does not go to auction and the player does not pay any fees.

A player can buy businesses from the bank or another player. A business owned by the bank can only be purchased if the player lands on its business tile. A player cannot buy arbitrary businesses from the bank from any tile.

Purchasing from other players follows the trade rule (see trading with other players).

###### Investment (a business upgrade)

Investments can only be purchased in business, where the player owns the entire series. A series is considered to be the businesses marked with the same color. The player can invest in the business on the tile they just landed on. The player cannot buy investments from one business tile for another business.

The player can decide how many investments they want to buy at once and pays the amount listed on the card as the investment price. The bank issues the player as many small tokens as they decided to buy, and these are placed on the game board where the business is located.

A maximum of three investment tokens can be purchased for a given business.

###### Monopoly (a business upgrade)

When a player lands on a business tile where they own the entire series and have already bought three investments (for each business), they can upgrade the business to a monopoly. The player pays the amount needed for the upgrade and returns three small tokens to the bank in exchange for one large token.

>[!note]
> When upgrading a business, investments are bought first, followed by the monopoly. To buy a monopoly, the player must leave the space (where they just bought investments) and land on it again later. A monopoly can only be bought on the space the player lands on—it is forbidden to buy monopolies from one business space for another business.

A maximum of one monopoly token can be purchased.

##### Fees

When a player lands on a business tile owned by another player, they must pay fees to that player. The fee amount is listed on the business card. The fee amount depends on the number of investments or a purchased monopoly. (The card lists the base fee as well as the fee for 1 investment or the monopoly fee).

A player who refuses to pay the fees goes to jail. The bank pays the full fee amount to the business owner, and the player in jail (who refused to pay) is fined 2x the fee amount. If the player cannot pay, they are out of the game, and all their businesses are acquired by the Bank.

(In this step, the player can request a loan from the Bank).

##### Selling a Business to the Bank

A player can decide to sell their business to the bank. If the business has been upgraded with investments or monopolies, the player must first sell these tokens at half price before selling the entire business for the mortgage price.

>[!note]
>* If the business has a monopoly, the monopoly must be sold first. It is then exchanged for three tokens, which are sold at half price respectively.
>* (Half the price of a monopoly is equal to the business price.)
>* (Half the price of an investment is equal to the mortgage price.)

The player who wants to sell their business must state directly to whom they are selling the business, and this decision cannot be changed. If they say they are selling the business to the bank, they must sell it to the bank. No other offer is accepted.

##### Trading with Other Players

Trading is possible only with businesses that do not have investments or monopolies. And with certain cards (e.g. Shortcut). If a player wants to trade businesses which have investments or monopolies, they must first sell those tokens to the bank for half price before trading.

The player selling their business (or card) decides whom to sell it to and for what price (because all prices are only a suggestion). If they choose another player, they must agree on a price and then complete the transaction. When selling to the bank, the business is sold at the mortgage price, and the card (e.g. Shortcut) is sold at the price listed on the card.

The player can also decide to put their business or card up for an auction. Only players who are interested can participate in the auction. Players must declare their interest in the business. Those who are not interested, or who do not express interest, cannot participate in the auction later. Once the selling player decides to auction the business, they must wait for the auction to end and adhere to its results. They cannot decide later to sell the business to the bank instead.

The player who wants to trade must state directly whom they will sell the business to, and their decision cannot be changed. If they say they will sell the business to player 3, they must sell it to player 3. No other offers are accepted.

A player who breaks this rule goes to jail and must pay a fine.

##### Forced Trade

If a player - who owns more than half of the businesses of a single color - lands on a tile owned by another player, they can decide to buy that business. In this case, the second player is forced to sell the business at the price listed on the card.

If players have an equal amount of businesses of one color, the right to a forced trade belongs to the player who landed on the other player's business first.

>[!example]
> Player 1 owns two businesses of the same color. Player 2 owns two businesses of the same color as Player 1. When Player 1 lands on Player 2's business, they can force a trade. When Player 2 lands on Player 1's business, they can force a trade. Then the force trade rule continues based on who has the majority.
> 
> The forced trade also applies to businesses of which there are only 2 in a series. For example, insurance companies. When a player who owns one insurance company lands on the other insurance company owned by another player, they can acquire it through a forced trade. The same applies to Webhosting and Internet Provider.

If businesses of one color are owned by more than two players, each holding one piece, a forced trade cannot be done. The same applies if the business is owned by the bank.

The price for a forced trade is the same as the business price. No fees are paid for landing on the business tile.

A player who refuses to sell their business in a forced trade goes to jail. They do not receive any payment for the business, and the business transfers to the other player who had the right to the forced trade - for free. The player in jail pays a fine (specified in the Jail section of this rule book).

##### Loan

If a player does not have enough money to cover their obligations, they must sell some of their businesses (either to the bank or other players), or mortgage them and take a loan. Loans are taken only from the bank by mortgaging selected businesses. The bank pays the player the amount listed under the mortgage column on the business card. The player marks the business card with a token to remember it.

A business being mortgaged must not have any investments or monopolies. These upgrades must be sold to the bank for half price before loaning the money. Even while the business is mortgaged, the player can still collect fees from other players.

>[!note]
>* If a business has a monopoly, the monopoly is sold first. It is then exchanged for three tokens, which are sold at half price.
>* Half the price of a monopoly is equal to the business price.
>* Half the price of an investment is equal to the mortgage price.

A player can repay the loan at any time, but no later than within three rounds, meaning - after passing the Bank tile three times. This rule applies regardless of which space the player requested the loan from. If the player completes the third round and cannot repay the loan, they lose their business, and it becomes the property of the bank.

If the loan is not repaid, the player must pay 20% of the borrowed amount each time they pass the Bank space. The interest is rounded up to the nearest 5,000 or 10,000. If the player cannot pay the interest, they lose their business, and it becomes the property of the bank.

>[!note]
>- (If 20% of the loan amount is, for example, 8 thousand, it is rounded up to 10 thousand.) 
>- (If 20% of the loan amount is, for example, 2 thousand, it is rounded up to 5 thousand.) 
>- (If 20% of the loan amount is, for example, 11 thousand, it is rounded up to 15 thousand.)

A loan cannot be taken if the player wants to buy a business. A loan can only be taken if the player lacks the money to pay off a debt.

#### Activities of the Banker

One of the players fulfills the role of the banker. The banker's job is to represent the bank and ensure the rules are followed. The banker performs their duties without compensation. These tasks do not affect the banker's account or property. Players can alternate as a banker or perform the tasks together.

List of tasks for the banker:

* Distributes money at the beginning of the game.
* Receives and issues money from the bank.
* If necessary, can change bills to smaller denominations and vice versa.
* Issues a deed of ownership to a player upon purchasing a business, confirming the player's rights to that business.	
    * The bank is the administrator of businesses - it does not own any businesses. It cannot collect fees or expand businesses with investments or monopolies.
* Issues tokens to players after upgrading business to investments, monopolies, or tokens indicating the number of rounds until a card's expiration.
* Issues money to players each time they pass Start or collects mortgage interest from them.

### Explanation of Individual tiles

#### Bank

The Bank is a tile where players receive a subsidy from the bank, and if they have taken out a loan, they must pay interest. To receive a subsidy or pay interest, a player does not need to land directly on the Bank space; they can also pass over it.

The action of paying out the subsidy takes precedence over paying the mortgage, and that takes precedence over any other action. (So a player first receives the subsidy, then pays the mortgage, and if they land on another player's space, they pay fees, and only after that can they trade businesses or buy investments or monopolies.)

The Bank tile consists of three spaces. Each tile lists an additional amount that the player receives on top of the subsidy if they land on that tile. If they pass over all the spaces, they only receive the basic subsidy of 300 thousand from the bank.

If a player lands on the Bank tile repeatedly, they do not receive an additional subsidy and do not pay extra interest for the mortgage. Instead, they roll the dice. If they roll a 1, 2, or 3, they must draw a LOSS card. If they roll a 2, 4, or 6, they must draw a PROFIT card.

The Bank space cannot be bought.

##### Bank - Starting tile

The Bank - Start designates the place where players begin their game (unless they decide to start their game by drawing businesses). It is also the place where one game round ends and the next round begins. If a card sends the player "to start," they stand exactly on this tile. The Bank - Start is part of the Bank tile group. When a player lands on it, they receive the subsidy and the additional prescribed amount (unless the card specifies otherwise).

The Bank - Start is a tile that cannot be bought.

#### Businesses

Businesses are tiles that can be bought when they are owned by the bank. When a player decides to buy, they pay the bank the amount listed on the card (or tile), and the money is deposited in the bank. The buying player then receives a deed of ownership for the business, containing all necessary information (such as type, price, fee amount, mortgage, expansion cost, and fees when the business is upgraded with investments or monopoly).

The deed of ownership entitles the player to collect fees from other players who land on the business space with their game token. If the business is owned by the bank, no fees are paid to the bank.

Businesses marked with the same color form a series in one industry. For a player to expand their businesses, they must own all businesses in the series, i.e., of that one color.

Businesses also have their type listed on the deed of ownership. This type is important for the Global Economy card. Different industries may have businesses of various types. The type does not affect the purchase of investments or monopolies.

>[!example] For example : 
> - Economic Profit --> Whoever owns Industries receives a one-time payment of 5k for each Industry they own. Fees are higher, including the base fee of the business.
> - Complaint --> When the player lands on Entertainment and Agencies, instead of the player paying fees, the owner must pay them the base fee of the business. This base fee can be increased by the amount the business is upgraded by investment or monopoly.

#### Agencies

An agency is a similar type of tile to businesses. They can be bought and fees can be collected for them. However, they cannot be expanded with investments or monopolies. The fee amount that other players have to pay depends on the number of agencies owned by one player. This fee is listed on the card under the names "Fee for 1 agency" and "Fee for 2 agencies." Agencies can be affected by changes in the global economy.

#### Entertainment

Entertainment is a similar type of tile to businesses. They can be bought and fees can be collected for them. However, they cannot be expanded with investments or monopolies. The fee amount that other players have to pay depends on the number of entertainment businesses owned by one player. This fee is listed on the card under the names "Fee for 1 entertainment business" and "Fee for 2 entertainment businesses" etc. Businesses in the entertainment group can be affected by changes in the global economy.

#### Insurance

The Insurance is a space that a player can buy. Insurance follows the same rules as businesses. The only difference is that it is immune to all changes in the global economy.

#### Casino

The Casino is a tile that functions like roulette. When a player lands on it, they can decide whether to play or completely ignore it. There is no penalty for ignoring it.

However, if a player decides to use the casino, they can bet any amount of their own money (loans cannot be taken for the bet). The rules of the casino game, as well as the possible winnings, are determined by the space the player landed on. In case of a win, the player receives their stake back along with the winnings from the bank. If the player loses, the bank takes their stake.

The Casino consists of a group of three tiles. If a player lands on it repeatedly, they can bet money again.

The Casino space cannot be bought.

#### Jail

Jail is a space that is not on the game board, so it cannot be landed on with a game piece.

A player goes to jail if they:

* Refuse to pay a debt to the bank (e.g., for a Loss card).
* Refuse to pay a debt to another player (e.g., refuse to pay fees for a monopoly in a gold mine).
* Refuse to follow the instructions on a Loss card.
* Change their decision about selling a business:
    * A player who wants to sell a business must state directly to whom they will sell it and cannot change their decision. If they say they will sell the business to the bank, they must sell it to the bank. If they say they will sell the business to player 3, they must sell it to player 3. No other offers are accepted.
* Change their decision about auctioning a business:
    * A player can decide to put their business up for auction. Only interested players participate in the auction. 
    * Players must declare their interest - those who do not show interest, cannot participate later. If the player says they are auctioning the business, they must wait for the auction to end and abide by its results. They cannot later decide to sell the business to the bank.
* Refuse to sell their business in a forced trade.
* Break the game rules deliberately:
    * Skipping player turns, manipulating the bank or player money, lying, or severely violating any important game rule.

When a player goes to jail, they are out of the game for three rounds (meaning they do not receive any fees or any money) and must also pay a fine. Unless specified otherwise, the fine is 100 thousand.

If a player repeatedly breaks the rules, they are out of the game and lose all their property, which goes to the bank.

### Explanations of individual tiles with cards

In our game, we have cards such as Profit, Loss, Shortcut, Global Economy, and Tax Office. A player receives these cards only when they land on the corresponding space (e.g., they receive a Profit card only when they land on the Profit space), and this can happen repeatedly.

#### Shortcut

Cards in the Shortcut category affect movement and dice rules. A player receives this card, when they land on the shortcut tile. They take a card with the arrow symbol and keep it for later, as it can be used in the next round. Alternatively, they can sell it to another player for a mutually agreed amount. This card can only be used by the player who drew it, either on themselves or their opponent who is currently taking their turn.

Each player can own a maximum of two Shortcut cards. If a player is supposed to draw a third card, they lose all arrow cards.

The card moves the player forward in a clockwise direction. If they pass the Bank space during this move, they receive the grant from the bank, but only once per round (after all players have taken their turns).

The Shortcut space cannot be bought.

##### Shortcut - ALTERNATIVE RULE

When a player lands on the shortcut tile, they move to the next shortcut tile indicated by the arrow. In the next round, they continue towards the Start tile. The shortcut tile can be also used to move back. The path through the shortcut is free. A player can land on the shortcut tile repeatedly.

#### Global Economy

Cards in the Global Economy category change the rules of the game, alter business prices, and generally mix things up.

When a player lands on the Global Economy tile, they must take the top card labeled Global Economy and place it on an open spot on the game board. The instructions on the card apply to the entire game and all players without exception (except for insurance companies, which are immune to this card).

The player who draws the card must mark it with their game piece (or another way), so that it is clear who drew the card. They must also mark it with tokens, with the number of tokens determined by the drawn card (which indicates the number of rounds until expiration).

Each time it is the turn of the player who drew the card, after they complete all their actions, they remove one token from the card. If there are no tokens left on the card, the card expires, and all rules it changed return to their normal state. The player places the card text-side down at the bottom of the other Global Economy cards, and the game continues according to the standard rules.

If a player lands on the Global Economy tile before its expiration, they follow the instructions written on the space they landed on.

The Global Economy space consists of three tiles. When the same player lands on it repeatedly, they do not take another card; instead, they roll the dice. If they roll a 1, 2, or 3, they must draw a LOSS card. If they roll a 2, 4, or 6, they must draw a PROFIT card.

The Global Economy tile cannot be bought.

##### Global Economy - ALTERNATIVE RULE

* EITHER: At the start of the game, players agree to ignore the Global Economy cards. In this case, when they land on the Global Economy space, they do not take any card. The space behaves the same as the Casino space, and its rules are mirrored (for example, if a player lands on the first Global Economy space, it is the same as if they landed on the first Casino space).
    * OR: At the beginning of the game, the first player draws a Global Economy card. When it expires, the first player draws another one. Alternatively, another card is drawn only when players land on the Global Economy space.
    * OR: When a player passes the Global Economy space and no Global Economy card is drawn, the player draws one card.


#### How to Proceed with Disputes Regarding Global Economy Cards?

* Card - Global Market : Players can trade businesses freely without it being their turn.
	* This sentence means that players can buy or sell businesses among themselves without having to wait for their turn. They can also sell their business to the bank at any time. 
	* Without this card, trading businesses is only possible when it is the player's turn -> they roll the dice -> and resolve the situation brought by the tile. Only after these actions can they sell a business or trade with another player. This card changes that rule.

#### Profit

Cards in the Profit category give the player money or other advantages.

When a player lands on the Profit tile, they take the top card labeled Profit. They read it and follow the instructions written on it. The card must be turned so that all players can read it.

Unless specified otherwise, money from the Profit card is paid by the bank. After performing the action, the player places the card text-side down at the bottom of the remaining Profit cards.

The Profit tile cannot be bought.

##### Profit - ALTERNATIVE RULE

* EITHER: Players decide to ignore the Profit cards. In this case, when they land on the Profit space, they do not take any card and receive 50 thousand from the bank. 
* OR: At the start of the game, players each draw one Loss and one Profit card (both types simultaneously). These cards cannot be seen by any player, not even the one who owns them. These cards can be used at any time in the game by the player on someone else. In this case, the effect of the card applies to both players (the one who used it and the one it was used on). Each player can have a maximum of one such card. Therefore, every time they land on the Loss or Profit space, they take one card but cannot read it. They must decide which card to keep and which to put back into the pile. 
* OR: When players land on the Profit or Loss space, they roll the dice. If they roll a 1, 2, or 3, they draw a Loss card. If they roll a 4, 5, or 6, they draw a Profit card.

#### Loss

Cards in the Loss category take money from the player or give them other disadvantages.

When a player lands on the Loss tile, they must take the top card labeled Loss, read it, and follow the instructions written on it. The card must be turned so that all players can read it. Unless specified otherwise, money from the Loss card is taken by the bank. After performing the action, the player places the card text-side down at the bottom of the remaining Loss cards.

The Loss tile cannot be bought. If a player refuses to follow the instructions on the Loss card, they must go to jail and pay a fine

##### Loss - ALTERNATIVE RULE

* EITHER: Players decide to ignore the Loss cards. In this case, when they land on the Loss tile, they do not take any card and must pay the bank 50 thousand. 
* OR: At the start of the game, players each draw one Loss and one Profit card (both types simultaneously). These cards cannot be seen by any player, not even the one who owns them. These cards can be used at any time in the game by the player on someone else. In this case, the effect of the card applies to both players (the one who used it and the one it was used on). Each player can have a maximum of one such card. Therefore, every time they land on the Loss or Profit space, they take one card but cannot read it. They must decide which card to keep and which to put back into the pile. 
* OR: Only Loss cards will be in the game. So when a player lands on the Profit tile, they draw a Loss card.

##### How to Proceed with Disputes Regarding Loss or Profit Cards?

* If it's not possible to determine which player has the most or least money, players with the same amount of money roll the dice. For a Profit card, the player who rolls the highest value receives the effect. For a Loss card, the player who rolls the lowest value receives the effect. They roll until a clear recipient is determined.
* When a card instructs players to roll the dice, they continue rolling until a clear winner or loser is determined. Players always roll with just one die.

#### Explanation of the meanings of the Profit and Loss cards

##### Card “Player moves to a tile”:

A player moves to the tile specified by the card or another player. If multiple players need to move, they take turns moving according to their order. The next player can only move after the previous player has moved and carried out the action specified by the tile. Movement of pieces is always towards the Bank space (i.e., clockwise), never backward (i.e., counterclockwise), even if it means skipping 20 spaces or half the game board. Every time a player passes the Bank tile, they receive a subsidy. When moving, players should check if a Global Economy card has been drawn. Once a player moves to the designated tile, they do not roll the dice.

##### Cards "Keep - can be used 1 time. This card expires after crossing the Start tile.":

The player places the drawn card beside them, where they store their purchased businesses. This card can be used once and only when it is their turn (but only in the next round after drawing it). It can be used before rolling the dice or after rolling the dice. In the case of "Loss" cards, the player must use it (but only in the next round after drawing it). If the player passes Start (Bank tile) and has not yet used the card, they must return it to the pile.

If the alternative rule is used and the effect should apply to two players, the effect of this card is applied immediately.

##### Cards "Player must pay":

The player is forced to pay the amount written on the card, either to the bank or another player. This applies to the player who received the card.

If the alternative rule is used and the effect should apply to two players, then both of these players (to whom the card effect applies) must both pay the remaining players, to whom the card effect does not apply.

##### Cards "Player Receives":

The player receives the amount written on the card, either from the bank or from another player. After following the instructions, the player returns the card to the pile from which they drew it.

If the alternative rule is used and the effect should apply to two players, then both of these players (to whom the card effect applies) must both receive money from all remaining players, to whom the card effect does not apply.

##### Cards for Other Actions

The player follows the instructions written on the card and, after completing the instructions, returns the card to the pile from which they drew it.

If the alternative rule is used and the effect of the card cannot be applied to both players, the card is ignored, and another card is drawn.

#### Tax office

When a player lands on the Tax Office tile, they must pay taxes and stay there for one round (until all players have had their turn). During their stay at the Tax Office, they do not receive any fees for their businesses.

The Tax Office tile consists of a group of three tiles. Each tile has an amount written on it that the player must pay if they land on it. If they skip all the tiles , they avoid paying taxes. After paying the tax, the player receives a Tax Office card. If the player lands on the Tax Office again in the next round and owns the card, they receive a discount on the taxes. If they skip the tiles, they must return the card to the bank without receiving anything.

If the player lands on the Tax Office tile repeatedly (i.e., immediately in the next round), they do not stay for one round and do not pay taxes again. Instead, they roll the dice. If they roll a 1, 2, or 3, they must draw a LOSS card. If they roll a 2, 4, or 6, they must draw a PROFIT card. (Even after repeatedly landing on the Tax Office, the player can trade businesses.)

The Tax Office tile cannot be bought.

##### Tax Office - ALTERNATIVE RULE

At the start of the game, players can agree to ignore the Tax Office tile. In this case, when they land on the Tax Office tile, they can roll the dice again.

### Ending the game

The winner of the game is the last remaining player, with all others having gone bankrupt, or the player who owns the most cards in the Bank category.

The game can also end by mutual agreement of all players, such as deciding to play for only one hour or a certain number of rounds. In this case, the winner is the player with the greatest wealth (see below for Calculating Wealth).

#### Bankruptcy

If a player does not have money or assets to cover their liabilities, they are out of the game. They hand over their remaining assets to the bank, which pays off all debts to the other players in full.

#### Bank Cards

In the game, there is a card that serves only to end the game. This card represents buying a share in the bank, which is just a narrative explanation and has no actual effect. Only the player whose turn it is can buy this card (see the list of player actions). Likewise, they can sell this card at any time. There are 15 "Bank" cards, and each costs 1 million.

When all "Bank" cards are bought, the game ends and the winner is the player who has the most "Bank" cards. If there is a tie, the winner is the player who also has the most monopolies, investments, or businesses.

#### Calculating Wealth to Determine the Game's End

1. The player with the most Bank cards takes 1 token.
2. The player with the most monopolies takes 1 token.
3. The player with the most investments takes 1 token.
4. The player with the most complete series of businesses takes 1 token.
5. The player with the most businesses takes 1 token.
6. The player with the most money takes 1 token.
7. The player with the most tokens at the end of the counting successes.

#### Other Ways to End the Game - ALTERNATIVE RULE

The game can also end in other ways, but always by agreement of the players

1. EITHER: The winner of the game is the player who upgrades two groups of their businesses to monopolies. 
2. OR: The winner of the game is the player who buys 45 businesses. 
3. OR: The winner of the game is the player who owns 4 groups of businesses of the same color (if there are two such players, the game continues until one owns 5 groups).
