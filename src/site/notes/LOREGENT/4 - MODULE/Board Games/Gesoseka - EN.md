### Gesoseka - ENGLISH VERSION
(Or - Gwent with joker cards)
v 15.11.2024

#### About game

Gesoseka is a strategic card game similar to Gwent, or other “gathering card games”. In this game players use their cards to score points. The player with the most points in a given round successes that round. The first player who will win two rounds, successes the entire game.

#### How to Play?

The game can be played by two players using either French-suited playing cards (32 cards) or Joker cards (52 cards). The deck is shuffled before the game, and each player takes ten cards. These 10 cards will be used for the entire game, as no new cards are drawn between rounds. The rest of the deck is set aside. Players look at their cards, and if they wish, they can exchange one or two of them. When players are satisfied with their cards, the game can begin. The player who starts the game is determined by the winner of a draw (which can be determined by a coin flip, dice roll, or any other method).

#### Actions During a Round

Players take turns during a round and they can perform one of the following actions:

* Place one card in their playing field.
* Place one card in the playing field of their opponent.
* Decide not to perform any action.

During their turn, a player can move cards around as needed. This applies to cards in their hand or those in their playing field. Regarding the opponent’s playing field, a player can manipulate only those cards lying there (not the cards the opponent is holding in their hand), and only when the player is placing their cards into the opponent's playing field. Player can manipulate only those cards that are currently affected by a playing card. In this case, they can also move cards around in the opponent’s field. After completing their turn, the player passes the turn to their opponent. The opponent performs their action and then passes the turn back to the player. This alternation continues until both players announce that they will no longer play in that round.

##### Inaction

A player may decide not to perform any action during their turn because they don't want to. In such a case, the opponent may perform another action. If both players consecutively decide not to perform any action, the round ends.

##### When a Player Runs Out of Cards

Both players take 10 cards at the start of the game. Once these cards are used up, no new cards are drawn. If a player runs out of cards, they can only pass their turn to their opponent, who can perform as many actions as they want (or as many as they have cards for).

#### End of Round and Evaluation of points

A game is played over two rounds. The round ends when both players end their turns. At the end of the round, the value of all cards in the playing field is counted, separately for each player. The player with the most points successes the round. They take all the cards from the playing field and place them next to them as a stack. If the round ends in a tie, neither player takes the stack. In such a case, the stack is set aside from the playing field. The player who will start the next round is determined by the winner of a draw (which can be determined by a coin flip, dice roll, or any other method).

The player who successes the most rounds, successes the game. The type or number of cards in the stack does not affect the outcome of the game, as they only serve to indicate the winner. If a winner cannot be determined after the second round, a third round may be played, provided the players have enough cards. If they do not, the game can end in a tie.

>[!example] Note
>The game can end after the second or third round even if a player still has cards in hand. The number of points determines the winner of the round, not the amount of cards.

### Informations about the cards

#### Cards Turned "Backwards"

This is a card turned in such a way that no one can see its value. A turned card can be of any value because it does not affect its function. A player can use a turned card to strengthen a numbered card, either in their own play area or in the opponent’s field. If they decide to strengthen a card, they visibly place their turned card under another card (the one they want to strengthen). This way, the turned card increases the value of the card above it by one point, effectively making it a stronger card. A card can be strengthened multiple times by placing more turned cards under it.

>[!example] For example : 
>When a player places one turned card under a card with a value of 7, its value changes to 8. If they place 3 cards under it, its value changes from 7 to 10.

Once the turn ends, the strengthening cannot be undone, and the card remains in this state until the end of the round.

>[!example] For example : 
> When a player strengthens a card in their field and ends their turn, this strengthening cannot be changed. As long as the turn is not ended, the player can manipulate the card as they wish. Regarding the opponent’s field, once a player strengthens a card, the opponent cannot remove this strengthening during their turn

A strengthened card can also be combined with a series.

>[!example] For example : 
> A player has two cards with a value of 8 and one with a value of 6. They strengthen the card with a value of 6 with two turned cards, thus creating a series of three cards with a value of 8.

However, the strengthened cards in a series must be in a smaller or equal quantity. So, two normal cards and one strengthened, or two strengthened and two normal. A series cannot consist of one normal card and two strengthened ones.

If a player wants to strengthen an entire existing series, they can. To strengthen such a series, however, they must use as many cards as there are in the series. If the series consists of three cards, they must use three turned cards to strengthen them. In this case, the level of the cards in the series increases by one (e.g., eights become nines). Cards are considered part of the series only when all are strengthened. A player can strengthen a sequence in this way as well, whether it is a pure or dirty.

However, cards that have had their alternative property used (i.e., cards placed horizontally) cannot be strengthened.

#### Cards with Numbers 2 to 10

For French-suited playing cards, the range is from 7 to 10. For Joker cards, the range is from 2 to 10. These cards are placed by the player in their play area, increasing their score by the value written on the cards. The points of these cards are then summed up.

The player can manipulate these cards freely. They can strengthen them, put them into a series if they have the same value, or remove them from a series if they have a different value (to strengthen an opponent’s card). Alternatively, they can move them from a series to a sequence and back again as it suits the player (the number of moves is not limited). However, cards placed in the play area can no longer be used to strengthen another card (i.e., placed cards cannot be turned “backwards”).

#### Cards Without Numbers

Cards without numbers are : Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), Ace (A), and Joker. These cards can be placed by the player in their play area, increasing their score by 10 points. These points are then added to those already gained from the cards in their play area.

However, the player can also place these cards in the opponent’s play area, activating their alternative property. In this case, they are placed horizontally (—) instead of vertically (|||), as if the card is lying down. Each of these cards increases the opponent’s score by 20 points.

Cards without numbers cannot be part of a series or a sequence.

##### Jack - J

In the opponent’s field, a player can exchange any card for a Jack. The exchanged card moves to the player’s field, increasing their points, but it has no other effect. (In this case, the card is placed vertically |||)

* Regarding series and sequences - the Jack can remove only one card from a series or sequence, thus breaking it. 
* Regarding a strengthened card - the Jack removes all cards (i.e., the strengthened card as well as those that strengthened it) to maintain the card’s value.

##### Queen - Q

When a player places the Queen in the opponent’s play area, they can draw two cards from the deck (the same deck from which cards were dealt at the beginning of the game). The player keeps these drawn cards in their hand and can play them when it is their turn, or in the next round.

##### King - K

When a player places the King in the opponent’s play area, the value of all numbered cards of the same suit as the King will be doubled. This applies to all players in the game, except the player who has the King in their play area.

* Regarding series or sequences - The entire series or sequence is doubled. 
* Regarding a strengthened card - The value of the strengthened card is doubled. If the strengthened card is part of a series or sequence, then the series or sequence is doubled


##### Ace - A

When a player places the Ace in the opponent’s play area, all cards in the opponent’s field that are of the same suit as the Ace will have a value of zero.

* Regarding series and sequences - A card with an adjusted value will drop out of the series or sequence. 
* Regarding a strengthened card - The card’s value is reduced to 0, but the strengthening increases its value.

##### Joker

This card itself does not add any points. However, a player can use the Joker to complete a series or sequence. For example, if a player has a series of 8, 8 and adds a Joker, it is counted as if the series has three cards - 8, 8, 8. The use of the Joker in a series or sequence does not have to be final. The player can move this card between series or sequences as they see fit.

### Series of Cards

#### Series

If a player places multiple cards with the same number but different colors in front of them, these cards are considered a series (for example, three sevens). Their value is not only summed but also multiplied according to the number of cards in the series.

* When there is only one card in the series, its value is not multiplied.
* When there are two cards of the same value in the series, their value is multiplied by 5.
* When there are three cards of the same value in the series, their value is multiplied by 10.
* When there are four cards of the same value in the series, their value is multiplied by 20.
* When there are five cards of the same value in the series, their value is multiplied by 30.
* When there are six cards of the same value in the series, their value is multiplied by 40.
* (A series can have a maximum of six cards of the same value.)

Only cards with numbers can be included in the series.

#### Pure Sequence
 
If a player places three or more cards of the same suit in front of them, which are in consecutive order, these cards are considered a pure sequence (for example, hearts seven, eight, nine, ten). The value of the sequence is calculated based on the card with the highest value.

* When there are three cards in the sequence, the value of the highest card is multiplied by 10.
* When there are four cards in the sequence, the value of the highest card is multiplied by 20.
* When there are five cards in the sequence, the value of the highest card is multiplied by 30.
* When there are six cards in the sequence, the value of the highest card is multiplied by 40.

#### Dirty Sequence

If a player places three or more cards of different suits in front of them, which are in consecutive order, these cards are considered a dirty sequence (for example, hearts seven, clubs eight, spades nine, hearts ten). The value of the dirty sequence is calculated based on the card with the second highest value (so in the sequence 7, 8, 9, 10, the second highest value would be 9).

* When there are three cards in the sequence, the value of the second highest card is multiplied by 10.
* When there are four cards in the sequence, the value of the second highest card is multiplied by 20.
* When there are five cards in the sequence, the value of the second highest card is multiplied by 30.
* When there are six cards in the sequence, the value of the second highest card is multiplied by 40.

### 4 players ? 

If there are enough cards available (for example, a 52-card joker deck), the game can be played by four players (or even more). The rules or conditions for winning do not change. The only difference is that if there is no clear winner after the second round, all the cards are put into one pile and shuffled. Players then take ten cards each again and continue playing.

A different item than the card decks is used to mark victories. The winner is the one who achieves two victories (or as many as the players agree upon).
