#### Kúzla zo Slayers

##### Ragna Blade
Fragment of the [[LOREGENT/Assets/Fleeting Notes/Lord of Nightmares\|Lord of Nightmares]],
Release thy heavenly retribution
Blade of cold, black nothingness
Become my power, become my body
Together, let us walk the path of destruction
And smash even the souls of the Gods
[[RAGNA BLADE\|RAGNA BLADE]]!!

##### Giga Slave
"Darkness beyond blackest pitch.  
Deeper than the deepest night.  
King of Darkness, who shines like gold upon the Sea of Chaos.  
I call upon thee, and swear myself to thee.  
Let the fools who stand before me be destroyed by the power you and I possess!  

[[GIGA SLAVE\|GIGA SLAVE]]!"

##### Dragon Slave
Darkness beyond twilight  
Crimson beyond blood that flows  
Buried in the stream of time is where your power grows  
I pledge myself to conquer all the foes who stand  
before the mighty gift bestowed in my unworthy hand  
Let the fools who stand before me be destroyed  
by the power you and I possess...  

[[DRAGON SLAVE\|DRAGON SLAVE]]!

Oh, source of all power,  
light which burns beyond crimson,  
let thy power gather in my hand.

##### Ra Tilt
Dwelling within the eternal and the infinite,  
source of all souls,  
everlasting flame of blue,  
let the power hidden in my soul  
be called forth from the infinite...  
[[RA TILT\|RA TILT]]!

##### Resurection
Blessed, humble hand of God,  
life and breath of Mother Earth,  
I pray thee come before me,  
show your great compassion to this person and deliver them back to us!
