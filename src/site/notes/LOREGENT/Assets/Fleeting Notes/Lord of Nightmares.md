>I am the mother of all darkness, I am the one who dream for years of all of abrogated lifeform, I am darkness beyond blackest pitch,  deeper that the deepest night, I am the sea of chaos the source of all chaos, - that is how they describe me - I am the Lord of Nightmares


The **[[LOREGENT/Assets/Fleeting Notes/Lord of Nightmares\|Lord of Nightmares]]** (Japanese: 金色の魔王ロード・オブ・ナイトメア Kanji translation: _Golden Demon Lord_, Romaji: _rōdo obu naitomea_, nickname L様 _L-sama_, also _LON_, true name **Lucifer**(https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_of_Nightmares#cite_note-1) Runic: ᛚᚭᛅᛞᚨᚠᚾᛁᚷᚼᛏᛘᚾᚱᛖ(https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_of_Nightmares#cite_note-2)(https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_of_Nightmares#cite_note-3)) is the creator and essence of the four worlds described and chronicled in [Slayers](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Slayers "Slayers") and [Lost Universe](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Lost_Universe "Lost Universe"). When she takes human form, it is usually in the body of a young, blonde-haired woman. She is neither a [mazoku](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Mazoku "Mazoku") nor a [shinzoku](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Shinzoku "Shinzoku"), and cannot be classified into such narrow terms. In _[Slayers NEXT](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Slayers_NEXT "Slayers NEXT")_ she is voiced by [Megumi Hayashibara](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Megumi_Hayashibara "Megumi Hayashibara") in Japanese and by [Lisa Ortiz](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Ortiz "Lisa Ortiz") in Central Park Media's English dub.

Her true form is the [Sea of Chaos](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_of_Chaos "Sea of Chaos"), an infinite golden lagoon made of chaos, or nothingness.

The Lord of Nightmares is omniscient, as everything in the worlds are made of her. In an [interview](http://homepage3.nifty.com/QPHOUSE/works/text/Slayers_Q&A/lon.html#q2) with the Mega Brand Project in BLASTER!, Hajime Kanzaka stated that the Lord of Nightmares wants the worlds to be destroyed and returned to the Sea of Chaos. According to him, this is because she feels lonely and wants them to be a part of her again. In truth, the Lord of Nightmares did not knowingly create the worlds; they were suddenly there, spawned from her without her consent. However, this statement of Kanzaka's appears to contradict the Lord of Nightmares' behavior in the [last episode of NEXT](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/EP26_(Slayers_NEXT) "EP26 (Slayers NEXT)"), as well as the manga version of the same storyline. On the other hand, given the somewhat joking tone of the comment, it is quite possible that he was being facetious about the Lord of Nightmare's loneliness.

She is not capable of being injured or destroyed, as nothing could ever be more powerful than her.

Two known [spells](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Spell "Spell") call upon the Lord of Nightmares' power: [Giga Slave](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Giga_Slave "Giga Slave") and [Ragna Blade](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Ragna_Blade "Ragna Blade"). While Giga Slave is the more powerful of the two (as it calls upon a far greater amount of LON's power) Ragna Blade is also very powerful. [Lina Inverse](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Lina_Inverse "Lina Inverse") is the only person known to have cast either spell, having created the former herself from knowledge found in a [Claire Bible](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Claire_Bible "Claire Bible") manuscript.

Using Giga Slave and Ragna Blade carries risk, as both spells will rapidly drain the user's energy. Giga Slave, if cast incorrectly or with interruption, will almost certainly cause LON to be directly channeled into the user, possessing him or her and potentially destroying the entire world. This happened to [Lina Inverse](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Lina_Inverse "Lina Inverse") in [Slayers NEXT](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Slayers_NEXT "Slayers NEXT"), but LON restricted her power to destroying [Hellmaster Fibrizo](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Hellmaster_Fibrizo "Hellmaster Fibrizo"), who attacked her. She later restored Lina to her previous human form when made witness to the perseverance [Gourry Gabriev](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Gourry_Gabriev "Gourry Gabriev") had in getting her back.

Mentioning the name of the Lord of Nightmares, especially in a long chant similar to a spell, will cause even the mightiest mazoku to tremble. It does not necessarily have to be in the form of a spell, but the knee of every mazoku will bow at the invocation of the Lord of Nightmares' name, if spoken knowledgeably- the name and the words themselves bring power. However, do it wrong and the same mazoku can become angry. When done right, their morale is so weakened that they are rendered incapacitated for several moments.

The Lord of Nightmares appears as **L** in the afterwords of the [Slayers novels](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Slayers_(novels) "Slayers (novels)"), discussing events and trivia with Author ([Hajime Kanzaka](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Hajime_Kanzaka "Hajime Kanzaka")) and occasionally Subordinate-S ([Demon King of the North](https://kanzaka.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby_Eye_Shabranigdu#Demon_King_of_the_North_.2F_Lei_Magnus-Shabranigdu "Ruby Eye Shabranigdu")). She often beats up on them, usually with a shovel, but other times with other objects.

Lord of Nightmares is one of the names listed on the [[LOREGENT/Assets/Fleeting Notes/Plane chart\|Plane chart]]
