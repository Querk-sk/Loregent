It shows images representing the [[LOREGENT/Assets/Fleeting Notes/Lord of Nightmares\|Lord of Nightmares]], [[Chaotic Blue\|Chaotic Blue]], [[Death Fog\|Death Fog]], [[Ruby Eye Shabranigdu\|Ruby Eye Shabranigdu]], and [[Dark Star Dugradigdu\|Dark Star Dugradigdu]].

The chart shows up in the [[LOREGENT/Assets/Fleeting Notes/Slayers\|Slayers]] REVOLUTION ending as a stone carving, with the emblems depicting Garv and Fibrizo destroyed, symbolizing their demise.

Another notable plane chart also exists which depicts the four shinzoku and mazoku leaders of the four worlds.
