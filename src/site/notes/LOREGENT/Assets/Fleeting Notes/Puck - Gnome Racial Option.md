### Puck Gnome Racial Option

#### History:

Something happened to pucks at the beginning of time. Some say that the god of kobolds hunted the pucks nearly to extinction, and the few of them that remained fled to the Plane of Faerie to escape him. Others said that it was the gnome god who abandoned the pucks in Faerie after the pucks greatly offended him, somehow managing to wipe the god’s perpetual smile off of his face and turning it into a scowl of anger.

Whatever the actual reason is, it was lost to time and erased from all memory so that it can never be repeated, but it forever changed puckish culture. While all gnomes are skittish, pucks take this to a new extreme. They hide away underground in the dark wilds below Faerie, away from most creatures that roam the plane, but even this is not enough. Pucks hide their faces from all by wearing masks that they never take off, even around those closest to them.

Despite not even knowing what they are hiding from, hiding has become part of their culture, and they take great pride in their masks, seeing them as an extension of themselves. They animate them, using their tinkering abilities to reflect their emotions upon their masks, making them frown and smile along with their face. Pucks only take their masks off when they feel an incredibly deep connection with someone, or upon their death.

Beings from the Plane of Faerie often feel emotions in a deeper, stronger way than beings from the Prime Material. Pucks’ fears were amplified by the Plane of Faerie, but so was their innate gnomish curiosity. Pucks call it their muse. They believe each and every one of them is born with one: an object of fascination that they simply must study and learn more from. A puck crafts their mask when they’ve found their muse, making it in the muse’s image, and they dedicate their life to pursuing that muse.

Pucks with a useful muse ascend ranks quickly in both puckish society, fey courts in general, and even the Material Plane, for those who cross into it. There are stories of pucks whose muse was the art of combat, and became impossibly great heroes, whereas others found their muse in medicine, or musical mastery. However, not all pucks are quite as lucky. Some muses are not seen as valuable by as many, or by any, and this is a great source of angst among pucks. Puck parents discourage children from taking on any hobbies that they feel won’t lead to a good muse, and yet it still sometimes happens that a puck finds their muse in something their culture doesn’t value. This is often a reason for pucks to become adventurers, joining others whose muse requires them to travel to study it in more detail.

There are even pucks who can’t seem to ever find a muse, and go through life without donning a mask, though their peers shun them for it. These often leave too, in search of their muse elsewhere in the feywild or beyond so that they may finally make a mask for themselves.

Whatever the reason is for a puck to leave the nest, and  whether they do it led by the invisible hand of their muse or by the lack thereof, they leave an indelible mark on anyone who meets their path.

#### A Note on Wording:

I’m aware that WotC have stated their intention to move away from using the word “race” in their content, replacing it with “species”. Because we don’t yet have the next iteration of the DnD corebooks, I’ll be waiting on changing the wording from race to species until then.

The skill you choose must be one that isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus.
