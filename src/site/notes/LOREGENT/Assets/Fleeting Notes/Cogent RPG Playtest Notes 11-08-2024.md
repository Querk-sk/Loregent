## Cogent RPG Playtest Notes

#### General Notes

Using the breakdown you asked for here.  Then I go into detail on the two different games.  

###### Need clarification in the rules (the rule is good, the explanation is bad)

- **Tools for Learning Needed**:  I don't think there is problems in clarity in the rulebook; GMs however could benefit from tools to pass out to players learning for the first time.  I am going to make a few (see below for details; initiative tracker, combat rule cheat sheet)
- **Initiative:** Players found initiative confusing.  I plan to make an initiative tracker / diagram to help clarify. 
- **Character Sheet:** character sheet needs to include a space for armor, weapons. 
- **Weapons: ** were prone to thinking the weapon bonus was to-hit, not to damage.  This can cause some confusion, though most of it was probably the teacher (me)
- **Dice Pool Auto-Success:** Not so much a clarification on rules, but I think a lot of GMs (myself included) will fall into using the dice pools to determine success verses failure.  An example of how things flow when success v failure (RAW) are generally decided before the dice throw and it is only narrative add-ons that are decided could be helpful.  Solve with a written Example-of-play.  
- **Uses for Destiny Points:** I think my players only picked up on the "Advantage" (succeed on 3+) use for destiny.  Again this is probably the teacher.  Can fix by including all Destiny Point uses on the Combat Reference Card.  

###### Rule needs work (the rule is bad)

- I don't think any of the rules are bad as such.  Main negative feedback I picked up is **people found the system too light**.  
- Init system can sometimes make it inelegant for the party to strategize if they want to go in a different order
- Commerce System works best for campaign play it seems - in a one-shot no need to save.  Making a dif commerce system that works for one shots could be something to consider.
- Easy to fall into a repetitive mechanical rut - no matter what I pick I build a dice pool and the rule-of-cool will interpret.  Something to ground different consequences (outside of GM fiat) might make players feel that they have strategic choices to make.  

###### Something is missing (there is no rule)

- **"Just Some Stats:"** in the second group, it seemed the players wanted more depth.  Without module add-ins the system becomes high-improv (which is great if that is what people are looking for).  But as a general note, I had a hard time running combat - it felt that players could suggest anything and it would be resolved with similar mechanics, decreasing the weight of the initial choice.  Leading to Cartoon physics.  If anything can happen (or if its just up to the GM to determine if it can), things can get out of hand.
- Highly recommend inclusion of Opportunity Dice.  It adds another mechanic that can  add some pressure / game variety.  **Creates a situation where there are clear consequences.**

- Recommend - Rules for defining fight locations getting between them, rules that create mechanical strategic choices.
- **Players loved making characters and mid-scene.**  Recommend including instructions on how to do that.  
- Recommend allowing "Specialties" to become like FateCore aspects (one player had the "specialty" "Always got your back")

###### There is too much (KISS)

- If anything, people want more.  There is nothing that is too much.  

#### Galactic Monster Hunter

###### Opening Scene

- "This story begins, as all good stories do, with you waking up on a burning ship.  The first thing you should do when you wake up on a burning ship is try and remember who you are . . ."
- Two of the players played the Abbott and Costello dunces as pirates attacked the ship. One player adopted the credit-hungry businessman. One player was the Xenobiologist (very Hagrid in his love for horrific alien monsters), and one was the chief of security.

###### Main Adventure

- Players were saved by a power-plant colony and helped them shut down the reactor before the plant blew.  Got to introduce Opportunity dice.  Players then decided to that since the opposing creature that attacked the plant likes electricity, they were going to spike the energy going into the southern colony (arms dealers) and see if the creature attacked.
- They have a tense diplomatic standoff with the arms dealers but are able to attract and (with some help from Destiny Points) jump onto the fleeing electric dragon and tame it.  
- Meanwhile the savy business man is trying to sell of the Xenobiologist's pet

###### Final Battle

- Creative, character appropriate battle plans are used.  I made a marker map to track general areas.  

###### Session 1 General Feedback

- **Positive:** The largest positive reported by the players was the making characters mid-scene.  They really enjoyed that.  They would have had that scene go longer.
  - **Recommendation:** we include a module about how to do mid-scene character creation well.
  - One of the players found it interesting (in a curious positive way) that the difficulty is usually 3 and you start with 3 dice, functionally gauranteeing you will fail until you start adding boxes in.  
- **Positive:** The players said the system is easy to learn.  They liked the d6 char sheet.  
- **Positive:** (GM Reported) Opportunity Dice seemed to fit into the dice pool nature of Cogent very very well.  Highly recommend we give Opportunity Dice a prominent place so players can know and use the tool.  
- **Note:** (Observed) Some of them were nervous to use highlighters on the character sheet, in case they want to edit.  As sheet is currently designed, that makes it much less elegant to use.  Meant for highlighting in dice.
- **Note:** Players reported they found initiative a tad confusing but I think that was the teacher (me). 
  - **Proposed Fix:** can make an easily printable initiative tracker with arrows that might help clarify.  People place themselves in order on the track.  Above track will be arrow ""<= declare actions this way (Higher init, gets more information)" and on bottom "=> resolve actions this way"
- **Note:** Players started defining specialties like FateCore aspects "Always got your back" etc.  I think that worked well.  
- **Note:** don't think I used combat to it's full depth, largely because teaching and gming at same time 
  - **Proposed Fix:** can make an index-card-sized combat reference for players to have.
- Overall this game went **very well** 

#### Steampunk World Faire

###### Opening Scene

- "This story begins, as all good stories do, with you waking up after being hit by a rampaging elephant.  The first thing you should do when you wake up due to a rampaging elephant is try and remember who you are . . ."
- Players recounted how they captured a two-headed tiger in the jungle for the fair.
- One of the players visibly had a hard time getting into the system.  Worth noting though, that he was not originally signed up for Cogent until the system he wanted to play was canceled.  

###### Main Adventure

- Party had a fight with a trained circus elephant with a steampunk hat.  ("A 'Gentephant' if you will, as one of my players ingeniously named it.")  Player got to use their Psionic powers
- They split the party to investigate the Magicians Tower, the Fire Twirl Circus and the airship race.
- Players wound up having to fix a steampunk machine at the Fire Twirl Circus.  Opportunity Dice went bad and they fled the circus before it blew up.  Lead to some funny moments.
- Fight in the magician tower when they went into an area they were not meant to be.

###### Final Fight

- Players on the ground got to use a bit of commerce points to catch up to the part of the party that was on the enemy ship.
- Two players got the job of loading coal on the enemies ship.  They stopped doing this to investigate.  Used Opportunity Dice to track how long the coal lasts without them building it in.  Opportunity Dice lasted FOREVER (even when on one die, kept getting above 4 for a very long streak) which lead to funny moments.

###### Session 2 General Feedback

- **Positive:** Players again said they really enjoyed making characters mid-scene.  
- **Negative:** "It's fine . . . it's just some stats . . ."
- **Negative:** problems with initiative, again probably the teacher (me)
- **Positive:** Easy to learn
- **Positive (GM Observed):** Degrees of success allowed me to introduce power ups and story elements - really like the degrees of success
- **Negative:** (GM observed) I observed times where I felt like I was getting into a mechanical rut . . . no matter the situation we were going to decide by dice pool which was similar to dice pool prior.
- **Note:** Commerce System clearly works best for multi-campaign play.  In a one-shot there is no need for player's to save and so during the last fight those that could get power-ups
- **Note:** Fights became very cartoon physics.  Partly that was the scenario with Steampunk elephants.  Partly without clear rules defining what is possible, the "Rule of Cool" comes to swamp everything until its less cool and more Tom & Jerry
